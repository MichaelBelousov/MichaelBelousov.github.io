But, I don't have the innate talent that\n      an industry-capable artist has. Perhaps dedicated practice that\n      I'm yet to undertake could bring me there. But programming has always\n      attracted me by feeling less redundant.\n      With art, sometimes you get stuck doing something a few\n      times in a few places. Especially if you're using an organic medium\n      (think pencil). If you incorporate programming, you aren't just making art.\n      You're meta-making the art. You're parametrically defining the\n      art, making the tools to make, and remake the art.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      A couple of decades ago, my dad donated $20 to help\n      make <a href=\"https://blender.org\">Blender</a> free and open-source.\n      I don't exactly remember what I was talking about with art or what,\n      but, he had the foresight to show me Blender.\n      I didn't figure it out quickly. I was young (maybe 11), and confused.\n      I never figured out to use it comfortably. I liked the concept, but didn't seek\n      out any tutorials. In my several first attempts, I was still just moving\n      vertices around like an idiot. My dad saw what I was doing and\n      showed me a video of someone else using Blender, combining tools to\n      do interesting things (it was actually the subdiv workflow).\n      The realization that I could twist and drive tools with each other,\n      and just think outside the box led me to try new\n      things, watch tutorials, and eventually truly learn Blender.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      Soon my dad would pejoratively call my time blendering: \"polygon twiddling\",\n      He probably wanted me experimenting with programming, but he his attempts to teach me\n      at a young age were a failure. It's hard to describe, but I had some weird psychological\n      difficulty learning from him specifically at that age, a strange quirk of my perception of\n      our parental relationship I guess. Thankfully, once I taught myself the fundamentals of programming,\n      that disappeared. I reintroduced myself to programming again in my senior year of high school.\n      One of my first experiences was scripting menial tasks in Blender with Python.\n      My dad ended up helping me with that too.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      Nowadays I'm not really sure how much of me is programmer and how much of me is artist.\n      I know I have friends that would definitely pigeon hole me, but I'd give it 50-50.\n      I probably both just as much, but art always seems to lead me to program and programming\n      seems to inspire me to art.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      Anyway here's a small collection of things I've made, they aren't\n      necessarily finished. Most were mostly made with Blender, but I\n      also used Unreal Engine, Substance, Krita, GIMP, and more.\n      A few have contributing authors (feel free to ask).\n      Several could be substantially improved, but I like them anyway.\n      </p>\n\n      <div className={styles.container}>\n        <ClickableImage src=\"/images/bad_face.png\" alt=\"bad_face\" />\n        <ClickableImage src=\"/images/bubble_shield.gif\" alt=\"bubble_shield\" />\n        <ClickableImage src=\"/images/cubes_mess.png\" alt=\"cubes_mess\" />\n        <ClickableImage src=\"/images/dirty_hog.jpeg\" alt=\"dirty_hog\" />\n        <ClickableImage src=\"/images/fire.gif\" alt=\"fire\" />\n        <ClickableImage src=\"/images/fire_dot.gif\" alt=\"fire_dot\" />\n        <ClickableImage src=\"/images/generated_bad_rocks.png\" alt=\"bad_rocks\" />\n        <ClickableImage src=\"/images/generated_nebula.png\" alt=\"nebula\" />\n        <ClickableImage src=\"/images/gold_hog.png\" alt=\"gold_hog\" />\n        <ClickableImage src=\"/images/magnum_back.png\" alt=\"magnum_back\" />\n        <ClickableImage src=\"/images/mongoose.png\" alt=\"mongoose\" />\n        <ClickableImage src=\"/images/parametric_armor_wear.gif\" alt=\"parametric_armor_wear\" />\n        <ClickableImage src=\"/images/revolver.png\" alt=\"revolver\" />\n        <ClickableImage src=\"/images/turret_wireframe.png\" alt=\"turret_wf\" />\n        <ClickableImage src=\"/images/undersuit_hand_greeble.png\" alt=\"undersuit_hand_greeble\" />\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default ThreeD;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
