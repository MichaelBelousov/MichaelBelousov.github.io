    <h3 style="margin:1pt;">On Centralization</h3>

    A new technological pandemic has been silently surfacing for the last
    two decades. Its effect has been subtle, but it's consequences were immediate 
    since, yet only now are they beginning to leak into conspicuity.
    </p>
    <p>
    With the great Cambridge Analytica media belly-flop, the American nation
    saw, and misinterpretted its first glimpse of the tumor that has manifested.
    The reception was not unexpected, in fact it is rather lamentably precedented.
    Facebook, and chiefly the mediocre Mark Zuckerberg are to blame
    for the escape of millions of web citizens' <i>information</i>, an oblivious
    misnomer. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Google, another principal player in what inevitably boils down to the data
    game, has been a tad smarter with their grasp. And still, Google <i>is</i>
    YouTube, one of the most influential media networks in modern history.
    In Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, etc, lie some of the greatest
    raw power in History, and we, the people, have been giving it to them gladly
    for the last twenty years. All of a sudden, they are imposing rules, a 
    privilege they rightfully own, on what many perceived as free interchange.
    But it isn't free, it shouldn't be, and it doesn't need to be. Because
    something more important is free.
    </p>
    <p>
    Facebook having given away our information is not baffling whatsoever. It is
    nearly an implication of the system of which we have been happily conforming
    to neatly.  What is, and should be dumbfounding is that we have allowed
    the utter dominance of centralization at all.
    </p>
    <p>
    To ascribe the responsiblity of the Cambridge Analytica scandal to Facebook is
    not an error per se, as a misplacement of thought. The error lies in us giving
    our information freely to a glorified advertisement firm. Skepticism is key to 
    optimism, but now our society is now accelerating towards technological subservience.

    The reason the public has trodden the path of centralization is purely availability,
    which is itself rooted in the simplicity of centralization in the software industry.
    The issue, however, is that centralization is an <i>intra-net</i> principle.
    Deeply nested within the internet itself, is the reality that our digital world is
    an <i>inter-net</i>, and the only thing that could possibly change that would
    be the complete monopolization and the simple autocratization of the internet.
    I hope we can agree that is an unfavorable end.
    As the natural state of the system is between (inter) users, and not amongst (intra)
    users, the only stable solution is that each user should be capable of
    yielding their own services. When Google yields them for us, we waive our right
    to the internet.
    </p>

    Humans have a deep need, a primordial predisposition, to shape the bizarre tumult before
    us into a neat stream. That is doubtlessly a correct, and even accurate response, 
    but care must be taken to note the instances of pure chaos. This preposensity has
    led us to assign blame across the internet to the deliverers.
    Unrealistic expectations for simple algorithms. And we keep shooting the messengers.
    </p>
    <p>
    Now, as the sickness is making its rounds, we need to bring availability to the
    peer-to-peer service model. We need to build a content-serving network
    to rival YouTube and Facebook. An application and system that is consumer-friendly,
    and consumer-hosted. Redundant, distributed, flexible, and free of the middle man. 
    A true anarchy that should satisfy the libertarian mind. A pure framework, where
    responsiblity can't be directly assigned to any third-party, where the consumer
    is alone, but the consumers are united, and even if the implementers regretted
    themselves (I have a feeling they wouldn't), it would be figuratively in perpetual
    motion, an unstoppable force.
