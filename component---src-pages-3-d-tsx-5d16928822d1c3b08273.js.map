But, I don't have the innate talent that an\n        industry-capable artist has. Perhaps dedicated practice that I'm yet to\n        undertake could bring me there. But programming has always attracted me\n        by feeling less redundant. With art, sometimes you get stuck doing\n        something a few times in a few places. Especially if you're using an\n        organic medium (think pencil). If you incorporate programming, you\n        aren't just making art. You're meta-making the art. You're\n        parametrically defining the art, making the tools to make, and remake\n        the art.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        A couple of decades ago, my dad donated $20 to help make{\" \"}\n        <a href=\"https://blender.org\">Blender</a> free and open source. I don't\n        exactly remember what I was talking about with art or what, but, he had\n        the foresight to show me Blender. I didn't figure it out quickly. I was\n        young (maybe 11), and confused. I never figured out to use it\n        comfortably when I was that young. I liked the concept, but didn't seek\n        out any tutorials. In my several first attempts, I was still just moving\n        vertices around like an idiot. My dad saw what I was doing and showed me\n        a video of someone else using Blender, combining tools to do interesting\n        things. The realization that I could twist and drive tools with each\n        other, and just think outside the box led me to try new things, watch\n        tutorials, and eventually truly learn Blender.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Soon my dad would pejoratively call my time blendering: \"polygon\n        twiddling\", He probably wanted me experimenting with programming, but\n        his attempts to teach me at a young age didn't pan out. It's hard to\n        describe, but I had some weird psychological difficulty learning from\n        him specifically at that age, a strange quirk of my perception of our\n        parental relationship, I guess. Thankfully, once I taught myself the\n        fundamentals of programming, that disappeared. That was in my junior\n        year of high school, I reintroduced myself to programming again. One of\n        my first real-life use cases was scripting menial tasks in Blender with\n        Python. My dad ended up helping me with that too.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Nowadays I'm not really sure how much of me is programmer and how much\n        of me is artist. I know I have friends that would definitely pigeon hole\n        me, but I enjoy both and often find ways to combine them. Art always\n        seems to lead me to program and programming seems to inspire me to art.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Anyway here's a small collection of things I've made, they aren't\n        necessarily finished. They are mostly made with Blender, but I also use\n        Unreal Engine, Substance suite, Krita, GIMP, PhotoShop, and more. A few\n        have contributing authors (feel free to ask). Several could be\n        substantially improved, but I like them anyway. I probably ought to\n        spend some time digging through other stuff to put here too.\n      </p>\n\n      <div className={styles.container}>\n        <ClickableImage src=\"/images/hand-magic-orb.png\" alt=\"hand-magic-orb\" />\n        <ClickableImage src=\"/images/revolver.png\" alt=\"revolver\" />\n        <ClickableImage src=\"/images/bad_face.png\" alt=\"bad_face\" />\n        <ClickableImage src=\"/images/cubes_mess.png\" alt=\"cubes_mess\" />\n        <ClickableImage src=\"/images/dirty_hog.jpeg\" alt=\"dirty_hog\" />\n        <ClickableImage src=\"/images/generated_bad_rocks.png\" alt=\"bad_rocks\" />\n        <ClickableImage src=\"/images/generated_nebula.png\" alt=\"nebula\" />\n        <ClickableImage src=\"/images/gold_hog.png\" alt=\"gold_hog\" />\n        <ClickableImage src=\"/images/magnum_back.png\" alt=\"magnum_back\" />\n        <ClickableImage src=\"/images/mongoose.png\" alt=\"mongoose\" />\n        <ClickableImage src=\"/images/turret_wireframe.png\" alt=\"turret_wf\" />\n        <ClickableImage\n          src=\"/images/undersuit_hand_greeble.png\"\n          alt=\"undersuit_hand_greeble\"\n        />\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default ThreeD\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
