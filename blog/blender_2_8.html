    <h3 style="margin:1pt;">Blender 2.8 has replaced photoshop for me</h3>

    I needed to do a top-down draft, a design of something I would be 3D-modeling later, and so I opened up
    my 2D drawing toolkit. Once photoshop, it was actually more recently Krita. I bumped the resolution to
    3000&cross;3000 pixels, and had to think deeply about it.

    The lack of dynamic resolution is so saddening
    in my drafting process. Having to worry about blurry details and zooming in too far, or zooming out too
    far, causing slow stroke finalization/rendering. So, using Blender for practically everything else and
    loving Blender 2.8 recently, I decided to check out its new 2D tools for kicks. Lo and behold, the lagless
    vector-based, infinite resolution, hassle-free zoom, layered, materialed, simple, beautiful 2D workspace of my
    dreams was before me. Gone are the days of drawing arrows to various scene elements to elaborate on them.
    Just zoom into them! You can just zoom infinitely and write inside them. The brushes are clean, and
    customizable. Erasing is instant (use point-erase), and rendering is lagless. And since you're not
    dealing with raster, there are <i>no</i> complex selections to perform. You can select strokes independently,
    select their points, move things, scale things, and it takes no time at all. You can <i>sculpt</i> your points,
    adding or reducing thickness of lines, moving them, adding some fuzziness, simplifying them, and more. It's not
    just good for drafting, but all drawing comes naturally to it. And you can even extend it to 3D! Draw in 3D,
    start modeling in 3D. Draw on your 3D models to concept some greebling if your artstyle demands it!
    It has never felt so easy to me. Blender has always been good for what it does,
    but it has never felt so exceptionally designed until now. Whether you're designing interfaces or levels, doing
    3D graphics work, doing 2D work, or any animation, definitely get into Blender 2.8 and start a new 2D drawing
    project. It just works!
