    <h3 style="margin:1pt;">Convex Hull of Polygons and the Melkman Algorithm</h3>
    <h5 style="margin:1pt;">May 4, 2019</h5>

    For my computational geometry course, I visualized a naive and the melkman convex hull
    finding algorithms, with some pedagogical narration, it
	was a fun opportunity to really learn Elm for HTML5 content authoring, and SVG rendering.

		See it here.

    The narration needs some work, the style is pretty poor and there's no mobile support,
    so I'll come back to it some weekend.
