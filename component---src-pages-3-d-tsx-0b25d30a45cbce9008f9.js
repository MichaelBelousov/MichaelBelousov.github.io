When I wanted to do digital art, he had the foresight to show it to me. I didn't keep to it for long, being young (maybe 11), and stupid I never figured out to use it comfortably. I liked the concept, but didn't seek out any tutorials. Later, when I returned to it, I was still just moving vertices around like an idiot. My dad saw what I was doing and showed me a video of someone else using Blender, combining tools to do interesting things (it was actually the subdiv workflow).
