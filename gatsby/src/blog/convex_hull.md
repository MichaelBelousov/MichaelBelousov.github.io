For my computational geometry course, I and a small team of my pears wrote a 
visualization comparing the naive and the Melkman convex hull
finding algorithms, with some pedagogical narration, it
was a fun opportunity to really learn Elm for HTML5 content authoring, and SVG rendering.
[See it here](https://mikemikeb.com/convex-hull-visualization/).

The narration needs some work, the style is pretty poor and there's no mobile support,
so I'll come back to polish it some night. Especially since I learned CSS properly since.
