For my computational geometry course, I and a small team of my peers wrote a 
visualization comparing the naive and the Melkman convex hull
finding algorithms, with some pedagogical narration. It
was a fun opportunity to really learn Elm for HTML5 content authoring, and SVG rendering.
[See it here](https://mikemikeb.com/convex-hull-visualization/).

The narration needs better interactivity, the style is pretty poor and there's no mobile support,
so I need to come back and polish it some night. It was made in [elm](https://elm-lang.org/).
