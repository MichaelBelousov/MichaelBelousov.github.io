But, I don't have the innate talent that an industry-capable artist has. Perhaps dedicated practice that I'm yet to undertake could bring me there. But programming has always attracted me by feeling less redundant. With art, sometimes you get stuck doing something a few times in a few places. Especially if you're using an organic medium (think pencil). If you incorporate programming, you aren't just making art. You're meta-making the art. You're parametrically defining the art, making the tools to make, and remake the art."), /*#__PURE__*/react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1___default.a.createElement("p", null, "A couple of decades ago, my dad donated $20 to help make", " ", /*#__PURE__*/react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1___default.a.createElement("a", {

I was young (maybe 11), and confused. I never figured out to use it comfortably when I was that young. I liked the concept, but didn't seek out any tutorials. In my several first attempts, I was still just moving vertices around like an idiot. My dad saw what I was doing and showed me a video of someone else using Blender, combining tools to do interesting things. The realization that I could twist and drive tools with each other, and just think outside the box led me to try new things, watch tutorials, and eventually truly learn Blender."), /*#__PURE__*/react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1___default.a.createElement("p", null, "Soon my dad would pejoratively call my time blendering: \"polygon twiddling\", He probably wanted me experimenting with programming, but his attempts to teach me at a young age didn't pan out. It's hard to describe, but I had some weird psychological difficulty learning from him specifically at that age, a strange quirk of my perception of our parental relationship, I guess. Thankfully, once I taught myself the fundamentals of programming, that disappeared. That was in my junior year of high school, I reintroduced myself to programming again. One of my first real-life use cases was scripting menial tasks in Blender with Python.
