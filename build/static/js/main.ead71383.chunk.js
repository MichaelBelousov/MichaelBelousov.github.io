Suppose we have some C language\nlibrary that we&#39;re linking to our amazing C++ project, but it leaves us with\na few sad C &quot;constructors&quot; and &quot;deleters&quot; surrounding a struct, like any\nnon-object-oriented language. Suppose we have a struct: <code>struct MyCType</code>,  \na &quot;constructor&quot; for it: <code>MyCtype* Create_MyCType()</code> and a &quot;deleter&quot;\nfor it too: <code>Free_MyCType(MyCType*)</code>.</p>\n<p>If you don&#39;t know what \n<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization">Resource Acquisition is Initialization</a>\nis, you should check it out, it&#39;s a useful programming idiom, often associated with C++,\nthat you probably already use somewhere.\nSo the question is, how can we get ourselves some nice RAII, scope-based destruction \nfor this type with minimal boiler plate? </p>\n<p>Our goal is that we can transform this code:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-cpp">void myFunc()\n{\n  CType* ctype = initialize_CType();\n  //do something with c type\n  destroy_CType(ctype);\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Into this code:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-cpp">void myFunc()\n{\n    WrappedCType type;\n    //do something with it\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Isn&#39;t that much cleaner? \nI&#39;ll look into using the STL for a great, simple solution, and then a custom\nwrapper emphasizing performance.</p>\n<p>Indeed, it turns out we can actually do what we want there\n<em>very</em> easily, having decent knowledge of the STL, the natural solution to the\nproblems that most over-zealous c++ programmers have.\nLet&#39;s give this an STL solution before we look into a custom one and later we&#39;ll\nsee what kind of performance gains we can find and if it&#39;s worth it.\nBut first, let&#39;s define some contrived &quot;C code&quot;, structs and functions that we \nwill attempt to wrap. We&#39;ll assume it&#39;s partitioned into headers and implementation\nsource as the files in our working directory of &quot;ctype.h&quot; and &quot;ctype.c&quot;.</p>\n<pre><code class="language-cpp">// === ctype.h =============\n\ntypedef struct {\n  int s;\n  unsigned long long t;\n} ExampleSubType;\n\ntypedef struct {\n  int a;\n  float b;\n  ExampleSubType* sub;\n} ExampleCType;\n\n// === ctype.c ============\n\nExampleCType* Create_ExampleCType(int i, float f)\n{\n  //pardon any mistakes, in my tests I used C++ allocation\n  //i.e. new ExampleCType{i,f, new ExampleSubType{5, ...}};\n  ExampleCType* result = malloc(sizeof(ExampleCType));\n  result-&gt;a = i;\n  result-&gt;b = f;\n  result-&gt;sub = malloc(sizeof(ExampleSubType));\n  result-&gt;sub-&gt;s = 5;\n  result-&gt;sub-&gt;t = 334323464592ULL;\n  return result;\n}\n\nvoid Free_ExampleCType(ExampleCType* in)\n{\n  free(in-&gt;sub);\n  free(in);\n}</code></pre>\n<p>So, how can we elegantly use the STL To initialize with our Create function,\nand destroy with our Delete function? The real hint should be our intended scope\nbased destruction. We can provide a smart pointer with a custom deleter, which\nhappens to match our intended signature. If it didn&#39;t, we could still probably use\na fitting lambda expression to map it to the required deleter signature. Let&#39;s do it\nas follows:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;\n#include &lt;type_traits&gt;\n#include &lt;memory&gt;\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\nusing namespace std;  //for brevity and tersity\n\ntemplate&lt;auto Create, auto Delete, typename... CreateArgTypes&gt;\nshared_ptr&lt;\ntypename remove_pointer&lt;\ndecltype(Create(declval&lt;CreateArgTypes&gt;()...))&gt;::type&gt;\nmakeCTypeWrapper(CreateArgTypes&amp;&amp;... args)\n{\n  using CTypePtr = decltype(Create(declval&lt;CreateArgTypes&gt;()...));\n  using CType = typename remove_pointer&lt;CTypePtr&gt;::type;\n  return shared_ptr&lt;CType&gt;(Create(args...), Delete);\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n  //Example example_inst{1, 0.5f};\n  auto example_inst = makeCTypeWrapper&lt;\n  Create_ExampleCType,\n    Free_ExampleCType&gt;\n  (-5, 0.5f);\n  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;peek at the instance&#39;s &#39;a&#39; member&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;\n  cout &lt;&lt; example_inst-&gt;a &lt;&lt; endl;\n  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;peek at the instance&#39;s &#39;sub&#39; member&#39;s &#39;t&#39; member&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;\n  cout &lt;&lt; example_inst-&gt;sub-&gt;t &lt;&lt; endl;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>This has some awesome advantages. Copy prevention (if you use unique_ptr), \nreference counting, all the things that come with smart pointers. The one\nissue is, what if the library you&#39;re using already does reference counting?\nWhat if this is just too much overhead for what you&#39;re doing? Exploring a\nmore raw wrapper is the next step, but before that, I&#39;ll first show what would\nmake a lovely addition to the above code... if C++ allowed deduced arguments for\ntemplated aliases. Using a function pointer variable type alias, we can craft\na single, make_Example() function with no template parameters. Unfortunately, without\ndeduction, you would have to explicitly list the argument types which is ugly\nand worst of all redundant. Either way, it might look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-cpp">template&lt;typename... ArgTypes&gt;\nshared_ptr&lt;ExampleCType&gt;(*make_Example(ArgTypes...) = \n    &amp;makeCTypeWrapper&lt;Create_ExampleCtype, Free_ExmapleCType, ArgTypes...&gt;;</code></pre>\n<p>So then, we&#39;re on to a raw wrapper. How thin can we make it?\nCan we make the wrapping inlined by the compiler entirely? I will explore the latter\nquestion and discuss it in another article. For now we&#39;ll just bring the wrapper into\nexistence. That question is what I&#39;d like to use to determine if the \nsmart_pointer solution is worth it in performance-critical contexts.</p>\n<p>We&#39;ll start with the idea for our template that hopefully will inevitably do everything\nwe want.</p>\n<pre><code class="language-cpp">template&lt;typename CType, CType*(Create*)(), void(Free*)(CType*)&gt;\nstruct CTypeWrapper;</code></pre>\n<p>We&#39;ve got function pointer type value arguments to our template already, and later\nwe&#39;ll add variadic arguments to match any signature for the Create function. This\ncould be used to match different overloads but unfortunately it seems difficult to \ninfer the overload so we can&#39;t do much without boilerplate as far as my \nintelligence falls.\nWe can at least infer the wrapped type itself from the function pointer arguments.\nFor now let&#39;s put in a simple implementation and see how it compiles.</p>\n<p>I ended up adding some additional templated aliases for the function pointer\ntypes, which makes it much more comprehensible, but these will disappear in the\nC++17 version.</p>\n<pre><code class="language-cpp">template&lt;T&gt;\nusing CreateFunc = T*(*)();\n\ntemplate&lt;T&gt;\nusing FreeFunc = void(*)(T*);\n\ntemplate&lt;typename CType, \n  CreateFunc&lt;CType&lt; Create, \n  FreeFunc&lt;CType&lt; Free&lt;\nstruct CTypeWrapper\n{\n  CType* wrapped;\n  CTypeWrapper()\n    : wrapped(Create())\n  {}\n  ~CTypeWrapper()\n  {\n    Free(wrapped);\n  }\n  //implicit conversion to wrapped type\n  operator CType* ()\n  {\n    return wrapped;\n  }\n  CType* operator-&gt;()\n  {\n    return wrapped;\n  }\n};</code></pre>\n\x3c!--\n\nI should probably say by now that there will be some elements of danger\nto stuff I am discussing, but one of the cool things (I think) you can do\nwith this type is safely cast a reference of it to the underlying pointer.\n\n--\x3e\n\n\n<p>Now let&#39;s use our contrived C example and see what happens</p>\n<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include&quot;ctype.h&quot;\n#include&quot;CTypeWrapper.h&quot;\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n\nusing namespace std;  //for brevity and tersity\n//our shiny type wrapper\nusing Example = CTypeWrapper&lt;ExampleCType, \n      Create_ExampleCType, \n      Free_ExampleCType&gt;;\n\nint main()\n{\n  Example example_inst;\n  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;peek at the instance&#39;s &#39;a&#39; member&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;\n  cout &lt;&lt; example_inst-&gt;a &lt;&lt; endl;\n  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;peek at the instance&#39;s &#39;sub&#39; member&#39;s &#39;t&#39; member&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;\n  cout &lt;&lt; example_inst-&gt;sub-&gt;t &lt;&lt; endl;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Assuming &quot;CTypeWrapper.h&quot; contains our templates we&#39;ve made, we should be good\nto go. Our output is:</p>\n<pre><code>peek at the instance&#39;s &#39;a&#39; member\n100\npeek at the instance&#39;s &#39;sub&#39; member&#39;s &#39;t&#39; member\n334323464592</code></pre><p>So we&#39;ve got implicit conversion to the underlying type, and an overrided \n<code>operator-&gt;</code>to\nprovide access to the underlying type. This should feel a bit worrisome actually, \nbecause our type <em>should</em> feel like a value, not a pointer, but overriding the \n<code>.</code>  operator is out of the question for good reason and the \n<code>-&gt;</code> syntax reminds us that our type really just contains an underlying\npointer so in my opinion it&#39;s, <em>ok</em>, not great. Definitely sinful.</p>\n<p>I tried with some difficulty to find out how one can template alias the type\nto provide a variadic constructor, but unfortunately I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s possible\nsince the first two types cannot be deduced in a class construction context\nand template aliases can&#39;t either (as far as I know up to c++17). The function \ndeduction context appears to correctly deduce the types even with only the partial\nexplicit template parameters, but the class doesn&#39;t seem to be able to. I couldn&#39;t\nfigure out a deduction guideline for it either, but I will\nlook into the difference in deduction rules for classes and functions, and confirm\nor fix my loss here.\nThis minimal and I think &quot;acceptable&quot; boilerplate is the\nfarthest I got for generic RAII wrappers of C-style types. If you&#39;re looking to C++-ify\nyour C-using code, try something like this, but clearly a heavy duty careful wrapper is \nthe real solution to any sufficient project. There are a few more hacks for quick wrapping\nof C types that I explored and may revisit later, but for now I&#39;ll leave the code where\nI left off, with a tidy wrapper which unfortunately has some definition boilterplate.</p>\n<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &quot;ctype.h&quot;\n#include &lt;type_traits&gt;\n\ntemplate&lt;\nauto Create, \n     auto Free,\n     typename...

So, using Blender for practically everything else and\nloving Blender 2.8 recently, I decided to check out its new 2D tools for kicks. Lo and behold, the lagless\nvector-based, infinite resolution, hassle-free zoom, layered, materialed, simple, beautiful 2D workspace of my\ndreams was before me. Gone are the days of drawing arrows to various scene elements to elaborate on them.\nJust zoom into them! You can just zoom infinitely and write inside them. The brushes are clean, and\ncustomizable. Erasing is instant (use point-erase), and rendering is lagless. And since you&#39;re not\ndealing with raster, there are <em>no</em> complex selections to perform. You can select strokes independently,\nselect their points, move things, scale things, and it takes no time at all. You can <em>sculpt</em> your points,\nadding or reducing thickness of lines, moving them, adding some fuzziness, simplifying them, and more. It&#39;s not\njust good for drafting, but all drawing comes naturally to it. And you can even extend it to 3D! Draw in 3D,\nstart modeling in 3D. Draw on your 3D models to concept some greebling if your artstyle demands it!\nIt has never felt so easy to me. Blender has always been good for what it does,\nbut it has never felt so exceptionally designed until now. Whether you&#39;re designing interfaces or levels, doing\n3D graphics work, doing 2D work, or any animation, definitely get into Blender 2.8 and start a new 2D drawing\nproject. It just works!</p>\n'},39:function(e,t){e.exports='<h1 id="empowering-latsubesubx-pylatsubesubxc">Empowering LaT<sub>E</sub>X (PyLaT<sub>E</sub>Xc)</h1>\n<h3 id="may-4-2019">May 4, 2019</h3>\n<p>The one nagging gap in my homework development stack early on\nwas an itch for \nprogrammability, that trait which Excel is alleged to have.\nBut I have a gripe with Excel. It&#39;s like Scratch for adults,\nA psuedoscripting language for the uninitiated and unlearned.\nPersonally, I&#39;ve always kicked up a Python interpreter any\ntime I needed a calculation, and I quickly began depending on\nPython+scipy for more intense derivations and data routines. I scratched\nup a utility module for producing LaT<sub>E</sub>X tables and pgfplots graphics\nfrom various data formats, and used it frequently with minimal\ncopy and paste glue (thank you Cygwin&#39;s \n    <code>/dev/clipboard</code>).</p>\n<p>But larger projects begged for more complete tools; like that assignment\ninvolving the visualization \nof 26 different samples from a dataset, as well as calculating some\nstatistical metrics about each sample.\nA sane person would have used the charting features\nin the Excel spreadsheet it was provided in, but that&#39;s outside the scope\nof this post.\nI exported to csv immediately and made an incredibly primitive \ntoolkit for embedding Python logic in LaT<sub>E</sub>X. Revisiting it a\ncouple of months later, I refined my toolkit massively and today I \nwould consider the design complete, but alternative implementation\napproaches merit some exploration.</p>\n<p>The first time I attemped glueing my Pythonisms into LaT<sub>E</sub>X, \nmy design was a tiny mapping from a LaT<sub>E</sub>X grammar extension\nto Python formatting key syntax.\nIf I were to write my LaT<sub>E</sub>X code directly in a Python string,\nand attempt to use formatting keys,\nI would probably spontaneously combust. It looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-python">r&quot;&quot;&quot;\\begin{{document}}\n\\frac{{ {kill} }}{{ {me} }}\n\\end{{document}}&quot;&quot;&quot;.format(kill=5, me=10)</code></pre>\n<p>That&#39;s almost as crufty as chained ternary expressions in JSX.\nBackslash doubling I can avoid by making it a raw string, but that\nisn&#39;t an option in all use cases.\nRegardless, I hid this formatting ugliness behind a script, which\nescaped braces for me, and interpretted the characters &#39;&lt;&lt;&#39; as &#39;{&#39;, and\n&#39;&gt;&gt;&#39; as &#39;}&#39;. So now I didn&#39;t have to brace every 5 characters, and the\nkeys looked distinct from the LaT<sub>E</sub>X syntax.\nMy dumb and ugly LaT<sub>E</sub>X superset templater took about 5 lines of \nPython code to process, and the source looked like:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-python">\\begin{document}\n\\frac{&lt;&lt;numerator&gt;&gt;}{&lt;&lt;denominator&gt;&gt;}\n\\end{document}</code></pre>\n<p>Quite literally, all my template processor had to do was replace all braces with\nescaped double braces, and then replace all \ndouble angle brackets with a single formatting brace, thus yielding\nthe valid Python formatting keys, while allowing raw LaT<sub>E</sub>X to look\nat least familiar.\nThen you just produce your values and/or data in your Python script, \nread this template from some file,\nand submit it to Python&#39;s formatting functinos with the expected keyword\narguments that you used in the document source \n(e.g. &lt;<numerator>&gt;).\nHere&#39;s the naive templating implementation:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-python">def load_pytex(path, **kwargs):\n  txt = open(path).read()\n  txt = txt.replace(&#39;{&#39;,&#39;{{&#39;).replace(&#39;}&#39;,&#39;}}&#39;)    \n  txt = txt.replace(&#39;&lt;&lt;&#39;, &#39;{&#39;).replace(&#39;&gt;&gt;&#39;, &#39;}&#39;)\n  txt.format(**kwargs)\n  return txt  # or subproc.check_output([&#39;pdflatex&#39; ...])</code></pre>\n<p>So this works, but it would be quite annoying to have a Python\ncontext so decoupled from the usage context. Calculating things\nwithout regard to the location in the document, and being\nunable to change the logic while editing the document without\nswitching files.\nCertainly I could do better? So I did something sinful.</p>\n<p>Fake macros in LaT<sub>E</sub>X will make this all look way more T<sub>E</sub>X-savvy. \nLet&#39;s add a <code>\\pyeval</code> pseudo-command, and a \n<code>pyexec</code> pseudo-environment so that we can get something \nlike so:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-python">\\begin{pyexec}\nname = &#39;John&#39;\n\\end{pyexec}\n\nHello I am \\pyeval{&#39; &#39;.join([name,&#39;Smith&#39;])}</code></pre>\n<p>Originally I implemented (knowing my transgressions) a naive\nregular expression based implementation, but this has many problems</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I want to ignore false ends in quotes and comments</li>\n<li>I want to allow counting of nested braces in pyeval</li>\n</ul>\n<p>expressions so that you don&#39;t need to escape all right\nbraces. (Regular expressions can&#39;t find the valid ending\n    brace of a nested expression)\nCheckout the following counter_examples:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-python">\\begin{pyexec}\nhate_you = r&#39;\\end{pyexec}&#39;  # we need to avoid ending if its in a literal\n\\end{pyexec}\n\n\\pyeval{h = {&#39;hello&#39;: &#39;world&#39;, &#39;x&#39;: {}}}  # which brace do we end on?</code></pre>\n<p>So I couldn&#39;t use regular expressions for this, but I still wanted it.\nBecause my LaT<sub>E</sub>X document source would look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-python">\\begin{pyexec}\nfrom scipy.optimize import curve_fit\nfrom random import random as rand\nfrom itertools import count, product as crossproduct\nbin = crossproduct((0,1),repeat=5)\ndata = list(zip(count(), bin))\n# add a count of set bits as a column\nfor row in data:\nd, b = row\nrow.append(b.count(1))\nrandpts = [[rand(),rand()] for _ in range(100)]\n\\end{pyexec}\n\n\\section*{Data Stuff}\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\nDecimal &amp;amp; Binary &amp;amp; 1-Bits \\\\\n\\hline\n\\pyeval{&#39;\\n&#39;.join((&#39;&amp;amp;&#39;.join(map(str,d)) for d in data))}\n% we can extract the above one-liner for reuse in tabular \n% construction and any horizontally partitioned context\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\n% use unpack+zip hack to get separate lists of x then y coords\nBest Fit: \\pyeval{curve_fit(lambda x,m,b: m*x+b, zip(*randpts))} </code></pre>\n<p>Mmmmm... delicious. It looks so much like Python yet so much like LaT<sub>E</sub>X.\nIt&#39;s both at once, without crippling either one! It&#39;s logic embedded in the document\nmarkup cleanly. So I did go and implement it. Originally I tried using a more\ncomplicated parsing approach, PyParsing, but it turned out to be far too complicated\nfor what was essentially templating. I ended up settling on parsing by character, due\nto the simplicity of the extension. There are a few performance enhancements I could\nmake but I&#39;m not in the need of them right now, and I&#39;ve noted them for posterity in\nmy README. This is PyLaT<sub>E</sub>X, and I put it on my\n<a href="https://github.com/MichaelBelousov/pylatexc">GitHub</a></p>\n<p>At last, I would argue, that we have a tool more extensible than Excel, \nit&#39;s got all of PyPI behind it, with numpy, scipy, and all the packages\nyou could want&emdash; embedded in your document.\nIf you like this approach, maybe you can be just as sinful and throw it into\nMarkdown, or change up the scripting language to your preference. So long as you\ndon&#39;t use php. Even if it&#39;s already a templating language.</p>\n<pre><code class="language-markdown">My Document\n===========\n\n```pyexec\nimport csv\ndata = list(csv.reader(&#39;mycsv.csv&#39;))\n```\n`&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;\\n&#39;.join(data)`</code></pre>\n<p>And as a final note, check out <a href="https://typora.io/">Typora</a>\nother cool ways to not use Office products.
