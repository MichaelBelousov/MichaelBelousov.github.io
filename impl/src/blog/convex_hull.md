# Convex Hull of Polygons and the Melkman Algorithm
### May 4, 2019

For my computational geometry course, I visualized a naive and the melkman convex hull
finding algorithms, with some pedagogical narration, it
was a fun opportunity to really learn Elm for HTML5 content authoring, and SVG rendering.
[See it here](https://mikemikeb.com/convex-hull-visualization/).

The narration needs some work, the style is pretty poor and there's no mobile support,
so I'll come back to it some weekend.
