So I'm currently daylighting as a tourist in Western Europe, but I am an
incorrigible workaholic so after a while I decided to moonlight as a programmer.

I've been pretty good at not sleeping (or *bad at sleeping* depending on who you ask) since I became a father, and my mind wanders when the family goes to sleep,
its hard to stop myself from working on something that I find interesting.
(What exactly I find interesting this time, I will share when ready).

But I did not bring a laptop.

So this brings me back to what I used to in college and really what I planned on doing on this trip.
I do all my C++, Zig, Rust, Node.js, and Python programming I need on my android phone, using [Termux](https://termux.dev/en/). My eyes may not always agree, but I find it a very convenient setup.

#### Setup:

- [my portable folding keyboard](https://www.newegg.com/p/0GA-08NW-000K1?item=9SIAS45HVK7458&utm_source=transactional&utm_medium=email&cm_mmc=TEMC-Delivery-Notice-USA-_-101932&utm_campaign=TEMC-Delivery-Notice-USA-_-101932&source=f) (I am not affiliated with that link whatsoever, and get nothing for linking it).
- any kickstand phone case or accessory
  The above keyboard comes with a kickstand but I use a case with a kickstand instead.

I think its sad that these days the split between "producer" and "consumer" of computers is getting more and more black and white. Sure you can still use the phone camera and some apps to "produce" e.g. TikTok content. But glaringly few people would consider it possible to create the TikTok app itself on a phone.

It's worth mentioning that I can't really use an iPhone for this, they're explicitly
designed for "simplicity" (often as a means to the end of "security"),
which is a tradeoff I don't personally want.
Sure you could buy a computer elsewhere and use an SSH client on an iPhone to log into it remotely, but that feels like cheating. Your still not holding the computer in your hands.

Not to mention how expensive an iPhone is. This entire setup is pretty complete for the cost. I don't know how it compares in dollar per linux cpu throughput to e.g. a chromebook.

So anyway, I think this little known set up

I was unfortunately that weirdo in the penultimate row of the lecture hall
with a kickstanded phone and bluetooth keyboard taking notes.
