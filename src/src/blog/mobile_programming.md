So I'm currently daylighting as a tourist in Western Europe, but I am an
incorrigible workaholic so after a while I decided to moonlight as a programmer.

I've been pretty good at not sleeping (or *bad at sleeping* depending on who you ask) since I became
a father, and my mind wanders when the family goes to sleep,
so its hard to stop myself from working on something that I find interesting.
(What exactly I find interesting this time, I will share soon).

But I did not bring a laptop on this very long trip.

So this brings me back to what I used to do in college and really what I planned on doing on this trip.
I have everything I need on my Android phone.
C++, zig, rust, gdb, node.js, python, bash, vim, tmux, etc.
All thanks to [Termux](https://termux.dev/en/).
My eyes may not always agree (especially when I use a termux split),
but I find it a very convenient setup.
I've even written several blog posts or chunks of them from there.

</div>

#### Setup:

- [my portable folding bluetooth keyboard](https://www.newegg.com/p/0GA-08NW-000K1?item=9SIAS45HVK7458&utm_source=transactional&utm_medium=email&cm_mmc=TEMC-Delivery-Notice-USA-_-101932&utm_campaign=TEMC-Delivery-Notice-USA-_-101932&source=f) (I am not affiliated with that link whatsoever, and get nothing for linking it).
- any kickstand phone case or accessory.
  The above keyboard comes with a separate kickstand but I use a case with a kickstand instead.

I think its sad that these days the split between "producer" and "consumer" of computers is
getting more and more black and white. Sure you can still use the phone camera and
some apps to "produce" e.g. TikTok content. But glaringly few people would consider it possible
to create e.g. the TikTok app itself on a phone. I think it's an unnecessary and sad division.

It's worth mentioning that I can't really use an iPhone for this, they're explicitly
designed for "simplicity" and "security" (I think those terms are conflated here but I'll
explain another time), and that's a tradeoff that I think is overrated.
For an iPhone, feel free to buy a computer elsewhere and login remotely from some app, but I don't
think that counts.

Also iPhones are more expensive. I have not measured my setup's linux-compute per dollar,
but it's often good enough for my tinkering and doesn't require a bulky laptop on hand.
That folded keyboard is lightweight and fits in my pocket (although on this trip I have it in a satchel).

So anyway, I think the uncommon knowledge that you _can_ develop your website or
tinker with native code from a phone, is useful, or at least interesting.

Maybe someone ought to take things further and offer a computer science course from just a cheap
android phone and open source software.

A maintenance note; I am going to try to write/blog more. Life has moved quickly in the last couple of years.
