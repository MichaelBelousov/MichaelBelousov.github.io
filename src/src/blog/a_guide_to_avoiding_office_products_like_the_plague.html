    TypeScript is probably my favorite Microsoft technology. 
    Static constraints and language constructs in the style of C++
    were a relieving addition to JavaScript.
    C# is also quite good, it has some excellent design choices as a language, 
    even if I don't really use it much. For instance, its struct vs. class semantics, 
    are an amazing
    answer to the issues of C++'s explicit referencing for dynamic types. 
    As for IDEs<sup>0</sup>, I'm not a fan of the Visual Studio environment;
    it tries to be too magical for me, and I prefer to work <i>with</i> my tools.
    The point is, I need a disclaimer. Microsoft does good things. 
    But this isn't about Microsoft. This is about that most
    pervasive corporate DSL<sup>1</sup>, Microsoft Office.
    </p>

    <p>
    I used Word as a main word processor for several years, it's a fine, 
    oft well-thought-out suite of tools.
    I've even used Excel, though I'm no spreadsheet savant. 
    But I haven't used either in a couple of years.
    Presently, in my undergraduate senior year, 
    my "Senior Design" team has a faculty coordinator.
    He's an alright guy. He's your mediocre academic Computer Science faculty. 
    Yet it's become blatantly
    obvious that he's but a pawn of the devil. He requires our group
    submit all assignments in <i>.docx</i><sup>2</sup> format. That is 
    probably the most oppressive limitation 
    I've ever been dealth in my academic career. 
    I have never been denied the sweet sanctity of a PDF option.
    </p>
    <p>
    That constraint prompted me to think over my 
    reporting toolset and how I've 
    been writing, diagramming, proving, compiling, and visualizing data for
    the last two academic seasons. And I wanted to share my somewhat
    unique approach, one that I find rather intuitive and satisfying.
    </p>

    <p>
    Without further ado; 
    if you, like myself, occasionally enjoy rejecting Facebook, Google, 
    or you know, anything that is convenient<sup>3</sup>, 
    then here's my recipe for avoiding Microsoft Office 
    365 days of the year<sup>4</sup>.
    </p>

    <h4>Ingredient 1: Typesetting - LaTeX</h4>
    <p>
    So you need a typesetter. Something that knows how to converse
    with your printer, perhaps, but probably not these days.
    The first and boldest choice is the engineer's typesetter,
    Steep-learning-curve LaTeX. 
    Firstly, I pronounce it as "laaaaaaaa-(sing it)-tech", unlike the
    rubber that I am allergic to.
    LaTeX is considered difficult to learn but if you come from a 
    programming audience then hopefully you've discovered the power of
    plain text. By allowing simple non-WYSIWYG<sup>5</sup> editing,
    the expressiveness of your other toolsets are empowered. 
    With plaintext document source, you can use your favorite text 
    ed<span class=vim >v</span>i<span class=vim>m</span>tor, and your
    favorite text processing utilities.
    In fact, with LaTeX, all that's really left is an itch for programmability,
    the trait which, Microsoft Excel is alleged to have. 
    TeX<sup>6</sup> does not initially allow you to embed logic, it understands its'
    place as a markup language. But you may want contextually appropriate
    logic for
    calculating statistical metrics, curve fittings, etc. You can do it
    separately and even through some packages that I should probably 
    research, but if your data changes, you need to reintroduce said
    changes and glue them back into your document. So we need a really
    strong and convenient glue.
    </p>

    <h4>Ingredient 2: Scripting - Python</h4>
    <p>
    I use Python as my example, since that's what I use, but you can 
    use PHP<sup>7</sup> for all I care. The idea is simple. Unlike your Office 
    document which will likely require some fancy APIs (Office 365) 
    or at least XML parsing to edit, LaTeX source files are just, 
    you know, plaintext. So you can edit them anyhow
    you like. The first time I ever did this, my approach was a tiny
    mapping from LaTeX source to Python formatting key syntax.
    If I were to just write it directly in Python source,
    I would probably spontaneously combust. Take a look:
    </p>
    <p class=terminal>r"""
\begin{{document}}
\frac{{ {kill} }}{{ {me} }}
\end{{document}}
""".format(kill=5, me=10)</p>
    <p>
    That's almost as bad as chained ternary expressions with JSX.
    But the idea is that python named formatting keys are denoted by a
    braced expression, and real braces are doubled to escape them.
    Backslash doubling I can avoid by making it a raw string, but that
    isn't an option in all use cases.
    Regardless, I hid that behind a script, and instead created a 
    simple alternate syntax for keyed formatting that wouldn't require me
    to escape common character.. 
    My dumb and ugly LaTeX superset templater takes about 5 lines of python 
    code,
    and looks like so:
    </p>
    <pre class=terminal>
    \begin{document}
        \frac{&lt;&lt;numerator&gt;&gt;}{&lt;&lt;denominator&gt;&gt;}
    \end{document}
    </pre>

    <p>
    Quite literally, all my code has to do is replace all braces with 
    escaped double braces, and then replace all 
    double angle brackets with a single formatting brace, thus yielding
    the original python source, while allowing raw LaTeX to look familiar.
    Then you just produce your values and/or data in your python module, 
    read this template from some file,
    and submit it to the Python formatter with the expected keyword
    arguments that you used in the document source 
    (e.g. &lt;&lt;numberator&gt;&gt;).
    After we find a better way to do this all, 
    we can even add a function to translate python 2-dimensional
    lists into the tabular cell format of LaTeX, which will make tabling
    a breeze. Here's my naive templating implementation:
    </p>
    <pre class=terminal>
    def load_pytex(path, **kwargs):
        txt = open(path).read()
        txt = txt.replace('{','{{').replace('}','}}')    
        txt = txt.replace('&lt;&lt;', '{').replace('&gt;&gt;', '}')
        txt.format(**kwargs)
        return txt  # or subproc.check_output(['pdfLaTeX' ...
</pre>
    <p>
    So this works, but it would be quite annoying to have a python
    context so decoupled from the usage context. Calculating things
    without regard to the location in the document, and being
    unable to change the logic while editing the document without
    switching files.
    Certainly we can do better? Let's do something sinful. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Fake macros in LaTeX will make this all look way more TeX-savvy. 
    Let's add a <code>\pyeval</code> pseudo-command, and a 
    <code>pyexec</code> pseudo-environment so that we can get something 
    like so:
    </p>
    <pre class=terminal>
    \begin{pyexec}
        name = 'John'
    \end{pyexec}

    Hello I am \pyeval{' '.join([name,'Smith'])}
    </pre>
    <p>
    Our environment can't be nested (the content is Python, not LaTeX...),
    so we will use regular expressions to do this rapidly.
    We have two caveats, however. Our <code>\pyeval</code> expression could
    contain a dictionary or set literal (any braces-containing construct). 
    Or, our <code>pyexec</code> environment could have
    valid Python code containing the environment end marker, e.g.:
    </p>
    <pre class=terminal>
    \begin{pyexec}
        hate_you = r'\end{pyexec}'
    \end{pyexec}

    \pyeval{ h = {'hello': 'world'} } # which brace do we end on?
</pre>
    <p>
    For simplicity, and since this is our own hack and not a production
    solution, we'll assume no one has used the end marker, and we'll
    require escaping of right braces in the \pyeval command. I'll leave
    a proper solution (for the pyexec problem) as an exercise to the 
    reader, and recommend looking into LuaTeX<sup>8</sup>, an extensible
    TeX compiler (though I think a compiler adapter would be sturdy and
    sufficient).
    On then, Stop and think of the regular expression for capturing all text
    between the pyexec environment opening and ending marker. Then think
    of the regular expression for the <code>\pyeval</code> argument,
    recalling that it cannot end on a backslash-escaped right brace.
    If you come up with better regular expressions than I did, let me know.
    Here's a simple implementation of our better embedded templating:
    </p>
    <pre class=terminal>
    import re
    from textwrap import dedent  # for optional starting indent
    def render_pytex(path):
        src = open(path).read()
        scope = {}
        def pyexec(match):
            exec(dedent(match[1]), scope)
            return ''
        src = re.sub(r'\\begin\{pyexec\}\n(.*?)\n\\end\{pyexec\}',
                      pyexec, src, flags=re.MULTILINE)
        src = re.sub(r'\\pyeval\{(.*?)(?&lt;!\\)\}',
                     lambda t: eval(t[1].replace(r'\}','}', scope), 
                     src) 
    </pre>
    <p>
    So let's see what our LaTeX document source would look like
    while using that.
    </p>
    <pre class=terminal>
    \begin{pyexec}
        from scipy.optimize import curve_fit
        from random import random as rand
        from itertools import count, product as crossproduct
        bin = crossproduct((0,1),repeat=5)
        data = list(zip(count(), bin))
        # add a count of set bits as a column
        for row in data:
            d, b = row
            row.append(b.count(1))
        randpts = [[rand(),rand()] for _ in range(100)]
    \end{pyexec}

    \section*{Data Stuff}

    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \hline
        Decimal &amp; Binary &amp; 1-Bits \\
        \hline
        \pyeval{'\n'.join(('&amp;'.join(map(str,d)) for d in data))}
        % we can extract the above one-liner for reuse in tabular 
        % construction and any horizontally partitioned context
        \hline
    \end{tabular}

    % use unpack+zip hack to get separate lists of x then y coords
    Best Fit: \pyeval{curve_fit(lambda x,m,b: m*x+b, zip(*randpts))} 
    </pre>

    <p>
    Now, the last thing to do is to use data files for your tables and
    your graphs and you've got a fully programmable document typesetting
    environment. You can even write a small latextools module like I have,
    for any common utilities like that nested join in the tabular that 
    produces cells for a 2-dimensional python iterable.
    At last, I would argue, that we have a tool more extensible than Excel, 
    it's got 
    all of PyPI behind it, with numpy, scipy, and all the packages
    you could want&mdash; embedded in your document.
    The next step is making sure we have a competent graphing utility,
    that can be integrated with our typesetter and scripting.
    </p>

    <!-- TODO: make more introductory for LaTeX and -->

    <h4>Ingredient 3: Graphing - pgfplots</h4>
    <p>
    I would say you could use any graphing utility and include it as
    any media you want, but that won't let you take advantage of the
    combination we've developed thus far. If you want to fully use 
    LaTeX and your scripting language, use a LaTeX
    integrated graphing package like pgfplots<sup>9</sup>. That way
    your script templating can be used in the graphs.
    Finally, the only thing
    that remains for our recipe is a substitute of Microsoft's Visio, 
    so that we can fill our documents with appropriate diagrams.
    </p>

    <h4>Ingredient 4: Diagramming and Visualization - *</h4>
    <p>
    There are a lot of diagramming tools out there.
    I've used primarily Blender, Google Drawings, Gimp,
    and some InkScape.
    Google Drawings is great for shapely diagrams, flowcharts, and
    etc. I use blender for more intense graphics and visualizations, 
    but I don't recommend learning it for typesetting.
    If Google Drawings is not independent enough, then
    learn Inkscape or even better Tikz.
    This ingredient is definitely the one
    that I have worried about the least. Diagramming isn't
    something I've had to make programmable often enough,
    and there are a plenty of tools for designing your diagrams.
    If you've needed to do it before, chances are you already have
    one, and you can throw that application's output into LaTeX properly yourself.
    </p>

    <!-- TODO: write a short compiler wrapper -->

    <p>
    Let's use an alias for a quick and dirty command wrapper.
    A better alternative would be an intelligent cli wrapper 
    that doesn't require you to pipeline your input. While we're being dirty, make
    sure to use an absolute path and stick this alias in your <code>.bashrc</code>.
    </p>

    <pre class=terminal>
    alias pytex='python /path/pytex_evalscript.py | pdftex'
    </pre>

    <p>
    And now we can do something like the following:
    </p>

    <pre class=terminal>
    cat paper.tex | pytex -jobname=paper
    </pre>

    <br/>

    <p>
    And done. Now we should have a full, convenient, brittle, homebrewed non-production
    TeX extension. For our personal use anyway.
    So now that we have our recipe, it's time for some notable substitutions
    </p>

    <h4>Substitute for 1: Markdown</h4>
    <p>
    An alternative markup language to LaTeX, that I use for taking 
    notes in classes, is Markdown<sup>10</sup>.
    Markdown typically renders to HTML but you can use tools like
    pandoc to convert it to a tradional paper style.
    If you've ever used GitHub, you've probably
    seen rendered Markdown even if you didn't realize it. Most flashy
    READMEs are rendered Markdown.
    You could also use ReStructured Text or some 
    other minimal markup language, so long as you can render it out
    to your required medium.
    </p>
    <p>
    The most useful things about embracing Markdown, are definitely
    the effortless simplicity of the language and the decoupling 
    of styling from content with CSS. Markdown will be much easier
    to learn than LaTeX, and you can still be inspired by our script 
    embedding and use a custom XML tag (Markdown includes HTML)  
    for Python embedding. It might look like:
    </p>
    <pre class=terminal>
    My Document
    ===========

    &lt;pyexec&gt;
    from operator import mul
    &lt;/pyexec&gt;

    _this is my document_, 
    and I **like** the number &lt;pyeval&gt;mul(5,3)&lt;/pyeval&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
    You could even use the inline source syntax:
    </p>
    <pre class=terminal>
    My Document
    ===========

    ```pyexec
    import csv
    data = list(csv.reader('mycsv.csv'))
    ```
    </pre>
    <p>
    You could go a whole another step and integrate some LaTeX math
    rendering, for the sweet, sweet mathematical formulas.
    Check out packages like <a href=""><i>katex</i></a> 
    to embed LaTeX in your markdown
    where you're already embedding Python. 
    At that point I hope you can somehow embed Python in the LaTeX embedded
    in your Markdown without getting hurt, but it would bring together
    the best of all worlds. Programmability (Python), extensibility (PyPI), 
    simplicity (Markdown), and complexity only when you need it (LaTeX).
    </p>

    <h4>Substitution for 2: Other Scripting Language</h4>
    <p>
    Are you the last person on earth, besides myself, who might like Perl? <br/>
    Are you twistedly enamored by the parasite that is PHP? <br/>
    Perhaps you're a node.js &gt; Python person, <br/>
    or maybe you want to focus on R and its visualization. <br/>
    If you think about it, the same principles of what we're doing 
    currently apply, just hope that templating with your language is 
    as easy to implement as it was for Python.
    </p>
    <pre class=terminal>
    \begin{CppExec}
        //someone (me) should totally do this with Cling
        #include &lt;vector&gt;
        #include &lt;iostream&gt;
        #include &lt;algorithm&gt;
        std::vector&lt;int&gt; ints = {1,7,5,9};
        template&lt;typename T&gt;
        operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream& os, const std::vector<T>& vec) {
            for (const auto& x : vec) os &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; ", ";
        }
        //I'd use R but I've forgotten what little I knew of R
    \end{CppExec}

    \section*{C++ Sucks}

    \pyeval{ std::sort(ints), ints }
    </pre>

    <p>
    And there we go. So you can take this stuff here and make a script
    wrapping around your favorite TeX compiler to evaluate your scripted
    expressions first as part of a compilation pipeline. Or you can see
    If you want to make this a production tool, go prevent
    the string literal end marker issue by ignoring string literals, 
    and research LuaTeX and general TeX packages and extensions to see 
    where a Python evaluation step can be added. I would
    appreciate it certainly. But that's a lot of work and while I'm 
    the only person doing this still, I'll just stick to my &lt;20 lines
    of code that works 99.99% of the time.
    </p>

    <p>
    Oh, and if you don't want to use any of this, 
    go check out Libre/Open Office.
