I have some projects in the works that I want to share soon.

But before I am ready, I will actually start streaming work on them occasionally.
My internet bandwidth is sporadic while traveling so I don't think I can do
it stably yet, but I'd like to try a few times. My mic will also suck until I
get back.

So if you wanna see some Zig programming, feel free to sit in at
