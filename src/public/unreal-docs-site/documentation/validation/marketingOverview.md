# Key features

- Check the quality of a digital twin through schema and data validation
- Check geometry clashes between design categories in a digital twin
- Perform advanced logical checks and detect inconsistencies through machine learning enabled validation
- Define suppression rules for clash detection based on classifications or categories

            <h2>Validate digital twin data</h2>
            <p>Set up validation rules to ensure correct classification and availability of data in a digital twin. Logically group validation rules into tests and auto-trigger validation tests as new data is introduced to the digital twin.</p>

            <h2>Detect geometry clashes</h2>
            <p>Perform clash detection between different disciplines and between different design categories, along with the ability to define schema-based suppression rules. The clash engine also supports features like overlap calculation, surface touching suppression, and reference hierarchy inclusion.</p>
