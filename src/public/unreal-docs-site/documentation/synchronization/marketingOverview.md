# Key features

- Synchronize engineering data and changes from its native format to an iModel
- Transform and filter iModels
- Set up a connection that makes team collaboration quick and convenient
- Export data from iModels to the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format

            <h2>Bring engineering data from various formats to an iTwin</h2>
            <p>Aggregate and align data from different formats in an iModel. Process data with the iTwin Connectors in the cloud. Track differences between synchronizations and keep the data up to date as new changes come in maintaining a change ledger. </p>

            <h2>Export data from iModels</h2>
            <p>Export data from your iModel to Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) for use in other applications. When exporting to IFC, you have different options in what format you can use. Currently available formats include IFC 4.3 RC1, IFC 2x3 and IFC2x3 CV 2.0.</p>
