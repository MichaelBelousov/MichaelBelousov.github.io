# Authorization

Authorization is required for all iTwin APIs.  For API samples, a shared authorization script is provided.  A deeper dive into authorization is provided in the Documentation section.

## Authorization for Samples

API samples require a desktop/mobile client (which yields an Authorization Code + PKCE client).  The New-OidcAuthCodePkce.ps1 script is provided for use with sample scripts.
