## ContextCapture REST API

***ContextCapture REST API***, is a service that turns images and point clouds into reality meshes, orthophotos and other by-products.

*ContextCapture* is articulated around workspaces and jobs. A *ContextCapture* workspace is a way to regroup similar jobs, and create gateways between jobs. A *ContextCapture* job is a job using basic reality data inputs (Images, point clouds) to create specified outputs (meshes, orthophotos, point clouds, orientations). Note that in order to use *ContextCapture*, you need to already know about *RealityData* API (also known as *ProjectWise ContextShare*) in order to upload and download data.
