## File Storage API

The Storage API provides the ability to access and manage files stored in the cloud and associated with a project. Organize files in a hierarchical structure with folders where each folder can include files with other sub-folders. The root folder is an entry point for using Storage API. There are two ways to retrieve it. One is by [getting project](/apis/projects/operations/get-project/) and the second is by [getting top-level folders and files](/apis/storage/operations/get-top-level-folders-and-files-by-project/). Both responses will include the link to the root folder. Synchronize files from Storage to an iModel. Check [Synchronization](/tutorials/synchronization-tutorial/) capabilities. Export issues and forms as pdf files to Storage. Check [Issues](/apis/issues-v1/operations/export-issues-to-storage/) and [Forms](/apis/forms/operations/export-form-to-storage/) APIs. Access the Storage [quick start tutorial](/tutorials/storage-quick-start/) as a guide to get started working with the Storage API.
