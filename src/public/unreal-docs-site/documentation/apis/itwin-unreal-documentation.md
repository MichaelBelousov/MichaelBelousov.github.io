# iTwin for Unreal Engine

Bring your iTwin data into Unreal Engine using the iTwin Exporter for Datasmith application.
With it, you can export iModel data into the Datasmith format and import it into
your Unreal project.

The iTwin Exporter for Datasmith offers the following features:

- Export your model's geometry and element metadata into Unreal Engine
- Export animation data such as schedules in your iTwin as level sequences in Unreal Engine
- Use existing iTwin saved views to filter exports by models, categories, elements
- In advanced use cases, leverage the power of [ECSQL](https://www.itwinjs.org/learning/ecsql/) for filtering exports.
