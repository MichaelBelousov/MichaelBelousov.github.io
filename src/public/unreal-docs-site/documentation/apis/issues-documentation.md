## Issues Resolution API

Issues Resolution provides a central repository where you can easily manage, assign, and track the progress of all project issues. Team members can communicate issues from the field to give project managers insight into issues so they can alert appropriate project participants to immediate action.

An issue includes a subject, description, assignee, and status. Comments can be added to an issue and they can be used to communicate among project team members. Additional information like files, saved views, and markups can be attached to an issue. The audit trail provides the history of all the changes to an issue.

The Issues API provides the ability to manage issues, comments, attachments, and audit trails.
