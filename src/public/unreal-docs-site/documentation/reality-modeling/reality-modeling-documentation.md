# Reality Modeling

Reality modeling is the process of capturing the physical reality of an infrastructure asset, creating a representation of it, and maintaining it through continuous surveys. Reality models add real-world digital context to infrastructure projects.

The Reality Modeling API currently provides the ability to retrieve information about reality data. The capability to add, process, and analyze reality data is coming soon.
