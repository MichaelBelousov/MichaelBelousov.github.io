Sample request:\n\n``` HTTP\nGET https://api.bentley.com/users/me HTTP/1.1\nAuthorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN\nAccept: application/vnd.bentley.itwin-platform.v1+json\n\n```\n\nWe are continually improving our APIs. The API version number will be incremented when we introduce a breaking change that is not backwards compatible. The following are examples of changes that are not backward compatible:\n\n- Changing the URI of the resource\n- Changing the method used to access a resource\n- Adding new required request parameters\n- Changing a field name or deleting a field from the response\n\nThe following changes are backward compatible:\n\n- Adding new API endpoints\n- Adding new optional request parameters\n- Adding new fields to the response\n\n## API release status\n\nAPI product releases have a well-defined lifecycle. The release status determines the level of support as described below.\n\n| API release status   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Support              |\n| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |\n| Technology Preview   | New functionality is sometimes released early as a technology preview or beta version.

Deprecated API versions will remain active in production for six months and developers should move to the new API version during that time period. New applications cannot use deprecated APIs.
