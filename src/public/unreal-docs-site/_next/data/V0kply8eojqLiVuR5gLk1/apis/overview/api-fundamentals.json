All data is sent and received as JSON.\n\nDates and times use ISO 8601 format.\n\n    YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ\n\n## Pagination\n\nAPIs that return collections could return a partial set of results and clients need to page through the results to retrieve all of the results. Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 1,000 items by default unless specified otherwise in an API operation's documentation.\n\nClients can use the optional **$top** and **$skip** query parameters to specify the number of results to return and an offset into the collection. If both parameters are provided the server will apply the **$skip** parameter first and then the **$top** parameter.\n\nThe server will attempt to use the values specified by the client but clients should be prepared to handle responses that contain a different page size. If the server can't support the given **$top** or **$skip** parameters it will return an error.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
