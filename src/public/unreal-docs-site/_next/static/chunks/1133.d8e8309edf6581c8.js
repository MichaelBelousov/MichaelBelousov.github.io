With this API, you can start exporting from an iModel and with a job run, the output file will be stored against the projectId provided. To get the file generated use Storage API.\r\n\r\nThe API supports following export types:\r\n\r\n- IFC (IFC versions supported - 'IFC4.3 RC1', 'IFC2x3', 'IFC2x3 CV 2.0', 'IFC4 RV 1.2').\r\n- LandXML.\r\n\r\n### Authorization\r\n\r\nThe export process usually takes time and is performed in the background. For that, we need to store the user's refresh token. You can get it by using [Get Authorization Information API](/apis/export/operations/get-authorization-information/). This API will return the current status and a redirect URL if the token has to be renewed."}}]);
