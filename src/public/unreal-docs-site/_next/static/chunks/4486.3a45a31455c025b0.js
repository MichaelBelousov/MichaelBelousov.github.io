Enable more timely and informed management decisions. For example, if project managers need help identifying the current status of deliverable documents, they can easily view the overall issued and rejected documents and the documents workflow.\n\n- **Best practices monitoring**\n\n  Track and enforce adherence to best practices with a view of specific data laid out in configurable dashboards to meet your needs. Project leaders can leverage new perspectives and track digital behaviors to ensure good connected data environment adoption.\n\n- **Near real-time analytics and trends**\n\n  Access a data-rich view into the present, past, and even potentially future project performance. Get ahead of problems by tracking design effort progression and where attention and corrective measures are needed. For example, project managers can actively track the progression of designs from work-in-progress to approved, identifying and mitigating schedule risk.\n\n## Design Insights\n\n- Use analytics to understand the implications of design decisions on key performance indicators (KPIs) early in the project\n- Identify hot-spots which are an early indicator of potential discipline clashes and project risk\n- Create business intelligence dashboards for digital twins\n- Integrate with Microsoft Power BI\n"}}]);
