In the reality data, you need to store a flat list of image files using Reality Data type *CCImageCollection*. For example, this architecture is fine:\n\n```\n/\n  - DSC_001.jpg\n  - DSC_002.jpg\n  - ...\n```\n\nwhile this one is not:\n\n```\n/\n  - DSC_001.jpg\n  - DSC_002.jpg\n  - ...\n  - SecondFlight/\n    - DSC_101.jpg\n    - DSC_102.jpg\n    - ...\n```\n\nWe advise you use *CC Image Collection* as logical capture units: an acquisition, a flight, etc. You also want the collections to be immutable. Meaning if you want to add images to a CCImageCollection called *DroneCaptureWaterPlant - Flight A*, don't. Create a separate one called *DroneCaptureWaterPlant - Flight A - Addendum* where you will add the remaining images.\n\nData should be uploaded in a single reality data, with type *CCImageCollection*."}}]);
