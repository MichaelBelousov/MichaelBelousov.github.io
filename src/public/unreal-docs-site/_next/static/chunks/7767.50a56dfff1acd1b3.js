This API has two operations:\n\n1. Enable Change Tracking\n2. Get Comparison\n\nBefore obtaining a comparison, it is necessary to enable change tracking of an iModel. This means that the API will be listening to any new `Named Versions` that are created on the iModel. When that happens, the API will process the new changes and store a summary of all the elements that have changed.\n\nAfter tracking is enabled and the iModel is processed, the comparison endpoint may be used to query for a summary of changed elements between any two given `ChangeSets`.\n\nFor more information on how to use the API, please check the [Changed Elements API Tutorial](/tutorials/changed-elements-api/)\n"}}]);
