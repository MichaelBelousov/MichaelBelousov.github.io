Each endpoint in this tutorial requires authorization. This tutorial is accompanied by a sample powershell script located [here](https://wwww.bentley.com). Authorization is provided as a separate script.\r\n\r\n## APIs/Endpoints used in this tutorial\r\n\r\nProjects API:\r\n\r\n- ["Add project team member" operation](/api-groups/administration/apis/projects/operations/add-project-team-member)\r\n\r\n## Steps\r\n\r\n### 1. Request access token for use in Authorization header\r\n\r\nObtaining an access token is required for all samples. See the _Authorization_ topic under _Tutorials_ for more information.\r\n\r\n### 2. Read users in from CSV\r\n\r\nReading users from a CSV is dependent upon your particular development framework and is outside the scope of this tutorial.\r\n\r\n### 3. Add each user to the Project\r\n\r\nAdding a team member to a project requires POSTing the request to the `projects/v1/{id}/members` endpoint.\r\n\r\n#### Method and endpoint\r\n\r\n```HTTP\r\nPOST https://api.bentley.com/projects/validation/38b7e366-bc20-4bb1-9572-0797cf5221f/members HTTP/1.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nTwo headers are required. An authorization header is needed. See the _Authorization_ topic under _Tutorials_ for more information.\r\n\r\n#### Required headers\r\n\r\n```HTTP\r\nAuthorization: Bearer <access_token>\r\nContent-Type: application/json\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Request body\r\n\r\nThe request body is specified as JSON and requires the email and roleNames properties. The API works with one user at a time, thus one _email_. Multiple roles may be requested via the _roleNames_ array. The request body may look like:\r\n\r\n```HTTP\r\n{\r\n    "email": "john.doe@my-org.com",\r\n    "roleNames": [\r\n        "Project Role 1",\r\n        "Project Role 2"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Putting it all together\r\n\r\nPutting it all together, and the request should look like:\r\n\r\n```HTTP\r\nPOST https://api.bentley.com/projects/validation/38b7e366-bc20-4bb1-9572-0797cf5221f/members HTTP/1.1\r\nAuthorization: Bearer <access_token>\r\nContent-Type: application/json\r\n{\r\n    "email": "john.doe@my-org.com",\r\n    "roleNames": [\r\n        "Project Role 1",\r\n        "Project Role 2"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n'}}]);
