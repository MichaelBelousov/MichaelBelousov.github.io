Project administrators can design forms for capturing meeting minutes, daily work logs, asset and site observation results, and more. Project members can then fill out these forms while working in the field. Like an issue, a form can be assigned to a particular user and can move through statuses in a workflow as work on it is completed.\n \nThe Forms REST API provides access to the raw data entered into these forms, including the ability to read and set field values, attached files, and comments, as well as view the audit trail (history) of a particular filled-out form."}}]);
