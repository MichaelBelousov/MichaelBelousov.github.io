Reality models add real-world digital context to infrastructure projects. The Reality Data API provides the ability to retrieve information about the reality data that is associated with an infrastructure project.\n\n### RealityData\n\nThe class defines properties that describe the content of the reality data and provides an access point to the data stored in a blob container, using Microsoft Azure Storage technologies. RealityData properties represent the descriptive data related to a reality data. In addition to this, reality data content is stored as files and folders within a blob container uniquely associated to this reality data. Individual files and folders follow, from the root of the reality data, a normal file tree structure.\n\nA more detailed documentation on RealityData properties is available [here](/apis/reality-data/rd-details/).\n\n### Projects\n\nRealityData are bound to Projects. Projects are used to represent engineering projects for an infrastructure asset. iModels, reality data, and engineering documents can be associated with a project. The Projects API is used to manage projects, project team members, and project roles. [See more information about the Projects API here](/apis/projects/overview/)\n"}}]);
