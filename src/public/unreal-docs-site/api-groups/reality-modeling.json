It enables faster processing and reconstruction of reality meshes thanks to the support of its unique parallel processing.\n\n## Perform automatic aerotriangulation and 3D reconstruction\n\nFully calibrate all images by automatically identifying the relative position and orientation of each photo. Employ automatic 3D reconstruction, texture mapping, and retexturing of ties and reconstruction constraints to ensure highly accurate models\n\n## Generate 3D mesh models\n\nProduce 3D models using a range of traditional CAD formats such as OBJ or FBX, point cloud formats, as well as innovative multiresolution meshes like the Bentley open 3SM or 3MX to ensure your models are accessible in your modeling environment.\n\n## Use imagery from a wide variety of cameras and sensors\n\nUse a wide variety of cameras, from your smartphones to the most sophisticated multidirectional land and air-based acquisition systems. Take advantage of each available image or metadata format to create your 3D models.\n\n## Employ scalable computing power\n\nSpeed production up by leveraging processing clusters that scale up and down automatically based on the workload. Enjoy parallelization up to 20 virtual machines per processing job and an unlimited number of projects running in parallel.\n","apis":[{"id":"/apis/contextcapture","description":"Convert photos into high resolution 3D reality meshes.\n","displayName":"Reality Modeling","name":"contextcapture","path":"contextcapture","tags":["General Availability","Reality Modeling"]},{"id":"/apis/realitydataanalysis","description":"Machine Learning on photos, maps, meshes and point clouds (defects, anonymization, indexing, assets and more).\n","displayName":"Reality Analysis","name":"realitydataanalysis","path":"realitydataanalysis","tags":["Reality Modeling","Technology Preview"]},{"id":"/apis/realityconversion","description":"Convert mentioned point cloud formats to web-friendly Orbit Point Cloud.","displayName":"Reality Conversion","name":"realityconversion","path":"realityconversion","tags":["Reality Modeling","Technology Preview"]},{"id":"/apis/reality-management","description":"Interact with your reality data.\r\n\r\nView, update, create, and delete reality data.\r\n","displayName":"Reality Management","name":"reality-management","path":"reality-management/reality-data","tags":["General Availability","Reality Modeling"]}]},"__N_SSG":true}
