The pipeline takes one or more PnID sheets as input and extracts text and symbol information which it returns under a `.json` format. A machine learning model detects components represented as symbols, such as valves, pumps, vessels, or off-page connectors, on the drawing and classifies them using the OpenPlant ProcessFunctional schema based upon ISO15926. See [Schema Editor](https://docs.bentley.com/LiveContent/web/OpenPlant%20Project%20Administrator%20Help-v11/en/oppa_Schema_Edit.html) in the OpenPlan Project Administrator Help and the [OPPID - Project Locations and Definitions wiki](https://communities.bentley.com/products/plant/w/plant_design_and_engineering__wiki/5718/5718) for more information. An additional OCR model detects all text information, both typed and handwritten. The detected text labels in the PnID drawing are linked to their corresponding components.\n\n### Workflows\nThe most common workflow for the PnID schematic to iTwin model is to extract information from raster PnID drawings and import it into an iModel to create a brownfield iTwin. If you have access to other sources of information, the results can be aggregated with other sources of information such as 1D and 3D data to quickly link and refer to. For example, this can allow bringing up the correct PnID sheet and zooming on the region of interest when clicking on an element in the 3D model or when querying a specific tag in a 1D asset registry.\n\nMore involved workflows can include using the extracted information to kickstart the re-creation of a drawing using the detected component classes and properties, their detected location, and matched tags. The recreated drawing can easily be updated if you change the process lines.\n\n### Inputs\nThe 'Schematic to iTwin': 'PID2iTwin' ML model inputs one or more PnID files. The files can be of the following formats: `.pdf`, `.png`, `.jpg`, and `.bmp`. If the files are `.pdf`, they can be multipage. Each sheet is extracted separately.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** All PnID sheets belonging to a single plant should be sent as one batch to the service for optimal results and to allow automatic linking of off-page connectors.\n\n- Files: list of single or multipage PnID files of a supported format (`.pdf`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.bmp`).\n\n### Outputs\nFor each processed sheet from the input, the following files are returned:\n\n- Prediction file: A `.json` file with the model's prediction. The file contains a header section and object sections. Under the key `asset`, the header section includes information about the input file and the inference task. The object sections contain detections for each object type. There are currently two object types, `regions` and `links`, which can be found under those keys in the file.\n\n- Raster image: `.png` rendering of the input file with coordinates that allow directly displaying the bounding boxes present in the output file. This raster image may differ slightly in dimensions, contrast, and orientation from the original file due to preprocessing.\n\nOutput files follow this naming convention:\n\n`<basefilename>_<suffix>_p<4digitsPageNumber>.[json/png]`\n\n- input file name: mypid.pdf &rarr; corresponding output file name is `mypid_pdf_p0001`, `mypid_pdf_p0002`, `mypid_pdf_pXXXX`\n\nAdditionally, a metadata file is returned per inference.\n\n- Metadata file: a `.json` file named `metadata.json`. This file summarizes the detections on the whole batch of processed sheets.\n\n#### Prediction File Description\nThe prediction file contains 4 parts:\n\n- `asset` - A dictionary.\n\n  - fields:\n    - `id: (str)`, Unique identifier for the inference file.
