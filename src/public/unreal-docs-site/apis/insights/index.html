<p class="iui-text-block iui-text-spacing documentation-paragraph">The Reporting story begins with Mapping. Mapping is a configuration process where all desired data sources are identified. These Mappings also will help describe what data is desired from each data source and how to structure it for Reporting. The Mapping process will be unique for each type of data source. For example, a Mapping for data from an iModel may not look the same as a Mapping for data from Validation, but ultimately all that data needs to arrive at one place and that is what Mapping orchestrates for you.</p>

Reporting and Insights\n\nThe Reporting API is a tool for aggregating digital twin data from multiple sources into one unified format and place. With the Reporting API, consuming your data through business intelligence applications such as Power BI or your own custom-built application is dramatically simplified.\n\n### Mapping\n\nThe Reporting story begins with Mapping. Mapping is a configuration process where all desired data sources are identified. These Mappings also will help describe what data is desired from each data source and how to structure it for Reporting. The Mapping process will be unique for each type of data source. For example, a Mapping for data from an iModel may not look the same as a Mapping for data from Validation, but ultimately all that data needs to arrive at one place and that is what Mapping orchestrates for you.\n\n### Reports\n\nA Report represents a collection of data. The way the Reporting API views a Report is as a collection of Mappings. With the Reporting API, you will assign one or more Mappings to a Report to be consumed by some application such as Power BI as a single data source.\n\n### Extraction\n\nMore often than not, some preprocessing will be required before data defined in a Mapping is actually available to be consumed as a Report. Endpoints are provided in the Reporting API to trigger the data extraction process. Depending on the data source this may be a one-time action, required for data syncs, or not required at all. See data source specific documentation to find out more.\n\n### Data Access\n\nAccessing the resulting data is done using a set of OData v4 endpoints. Any application that can use the OData protocol such as Power BI will automatically understand how to fetch your Report data. Access to data can either follow the standard Bearer Token authorization shared with all other Reporting APIs, or use Basic Authentication with the credentials and keys provided via the [API Keys](/apis/insights/api-keys) dashboard.\n\n### Typical Workflow\n\n_Described for an iModel data source.

Each CustomCalculation defines a column in the output data which is filled with values calculated using the given formula for each element that is returned by the Group's query.\r\n\r\n### CustomCalculations\r\n\r\nCustomCalculation is a kind of Group property which has a mathematical formula. CustomCalculation defines a column in the output data which gets filled with a result of the formula evaluation. The formula is evaluated during each extraction for each row of the Group's query result.\r\n\r\nThe formula supports using other columns (GroupProperty, CalculatedProperty or CustomCalculation entities) as variables. Recursive formulas are not supported, i.e., formula containing a variable `X` is not supported inside a CustomCalculation with a `propertyName` equal to `X`.\r\n\r\nSupported operators:\r\n\r\n- Unary `-` (negation) has a precedence of 5 and right associativity\r\n- `**` (exponentiation) has a precedence of 4 and right associativity\r\n- `*` (multiplication) has a precedence of 3 and left associativity\r\n- `/` (division) has a precedence of 3 and left associativity\r\n- `%` (remainder) has a precedence of 3 and left associativity\r\n- `+` (addition) has a precedence of 2 and left associativity\r\n- Binary `-` (subtraction) has a precedence of 2 and left associativity\r\n\r\nParenthesis `(` and `)` can be used to change the precedence of operations. Variables, constants, and functions have a precedence of 1 and left associativity.\r\n\r\nSupported constants:\r\n\r\n- `E` - Euler's constant and the base of natural logarithms (approx. 2.718)\r\n- `LN2` - natural logarithm of 2 (approx. 0.693)\r\n- `LN10` - natural logarithm of 10 (approx. 2.303)\r\n- `LOG2E` - base-2 logarithm of `E` (approx. 1.443)\r\n- `PI` - ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter (approx. 3.14159)\r\n- `SQRT1_2` - square root of ½ (approx. 0.707)\r\n- `SQRT2` - square root of 2 (approx. 1.414)\r\n\r\nSupported numeric constant formats:\r\n\r\n- Decimal, e.g., `123` or `1.123`\r\n- Binary (base 2), e.g., `0b1010`\r\n- Octal (base 8), e.g., `0o1234567`\r\n- Hexadecimal (base 16), e.g., `0x123af`\r\n- Scientific notation, e.g., `1.123e+3`\r\n\r\nSupported functions:\r\n\r\n- `abs(x)` - returns the absolute value of `x`\r\n- `acos(x)` - returns the arccosine of `x`\r\n- `acosh(x)` - returns the hyperbolic arccosine of `x`\r\n- `asin(x)` - returns the arcsine of `x`\r\n- `asinh(x)` - returns the hyperbolic arcsine of `x`\r\n- `atan(x)` - returns the arctangent of `x`\r\n- `atanh(x)` - returns the hyperbolic arctangent of `x`\r\n- `atan2(y, x)` - returns the arctangent of the quotient of `y` divided by `x`\r\n- `cbrt(x)` - returns the cube root of `x`\r\n- `ceil(x)` - returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x`\r\n- `clz32(x)` - returns the number of leading zero bits of the 32-bit integer `x`\r\n- `cos(x)` - returns the cosine of `x`\r\n- `cosh(x)` - returns the hyperbolic cosine of `x`\r\n- `exp(x)` - returns `E ** x` or `pow(E, x)`, where `x` is the argument, and `E` is Euler's constant (2.718…, the base of the natural logarithm)\r\n- `expm1(x)` - returns subtracting 1 from `exp(x)`\r\n- `floor(x)` - returns the largest integer less than or equal to `x`\r\n- `fround(x)` - returns the nearest single precision float representation of `x`\r\n- `hypot(x, y[, z[, …]])` - returns the square root of the sum of squares of its arguments\r\n- `imul(x, y)` - returns the result of the 32-bit integer multiplication of `x` and `y`\r\n- `log(x)` - returns the natural logarithm of `x`\r\n- `log1p(x)` - returns the natural logarithm of `1 + x`\r\n- `log10(x)` - returns the base-10 logarithm of `x`\r\n- `log2(x)` - returns the base-2 logarithm of `x`\r\n- `max(x, y[, z[, …]])` - returns the largest of 2 or more numbers\r\n- `min(x, y[, z[, …]])` - returns the smallest of 2 or more numbers\r\n- `pow(x, y)` - returns base `x` to the exponent power `y` (i.e., `x**y`)\r\n- `random()` - returns a pseudo-random number between 0 and 1.

All rows within a single output table get the same value\r\n- `round(x)` - returns the value of the number `x` rounded to the nearest integer\r\n- `sign(x)` - returns the sign of the `x`, indicating whether `x` is positive (`1`), negative (`-1`), or zero (`0`)\r\n- `sin(x)` - returns the sine of `x`\r\n- `sinh(x)` - returns the hyperbolic sine of `x`\r\n- `sqrt(x)` - returns the positive square root of `x`\r\n- `tan(x)` - returns the tangent of `x`\r\n- `tanh(x)` - returns the hyperbolic tangent of `x`\r\n- `trunc(x)` - returns the integer portion of `x`, removing any fractional digits\r\n\r\nExamples of supported formulas:\r\n\r\n- `min(A * B, B * C, A * C)` - if `A`, `B`, and `C` are 3 different lengths of box edges, then this formula will result in the smallest side surface area of that box\r\n- `min * max` - formula does not have parenthesis after function names, so the `min` and `max` operands are treated as variables (other columns), not as functions. If the Group has columns `min` and `max`, and their values are `2` and `5`, then the result of this formula is `10` for that row\r\n- `2 ** 3` - 2 raised to the power of 3. Result will be 8. This can also be written as `pow(2, 3)`\r\n- `min(cos(X), sin(X))` - function nesting is supported\r\n- `A * (B + C)` - `A` multiplied by the sum of `B` and `C`\r\n- `A * B + C` - same as `(A * B) + C`\r\n\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nRequires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `insights:modify`.\r\n\r\nFor more documentation on authorization and how to get access token visit [OAUTH2 Authorization](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/authorization/) page.\r\n\r\n### Authorization\r\n\r\nUser must have `imodels_write` permission(s) assigned at the Project level. iModel specific permissions may also be applied at the iModel level if iModel level permissions are enabled.\r\n\r\nAlternatively the user should be an Organization Administrator for the Organization that owns a given Project or iModel.\r\n\r\nAn Organization Administrator must have at least one of the following roles assigned in User Management: Account Administrator, Co-Administrator, or CONNECT Services Administrator.

If either `ECInstanceId` or `ECClassId` column is not selected, the query will not produce any output.\r\n\r\nIf the `query` parameter does not contain a valid ECSql query, then it must be equal to `bis.Element`, `bis.ElementAspect`, or any of their descendants.\r\n\r\nThe ECClassId format `{schemaName}:{schemaItemName}` where `schemaName` does not contain a 3-part version number is supported.\r\n\r\nThe ECClassId format `{schemaName}.{schemaItemName}` is supported.\r\n\r\nThe ECClassId format `{schemaAlias}:{schemaItemName}` where `schemaAlias` is the alias of a `schemaName` is supported.\r\n\r\nThe ECClassId format `{schemaFullName}:{schemaItemName}` where `schemaFullName` contains a 3-part version number is _not_ supported.\r\n\r\nWhen the given ECClassId is equal to `bis.Element` or is one of its descendants, then all elements with the ECClassId will be selected.\r\n\r\nWhen the given ECClassId is equal to `bis.ElementAspect` or is one of its descendants, then all elements that have such aspect will be selected.\r\n\r\nWhen the given ECClassId is none of the above, the query will not produce any output.\r\n\r\n- If a class `Building.Beam` does not have any subclasses and the `query` parameter is set to `Building.Beam`, then all elements with ECClassIds of `Building.Beam` will be selected\r\n- If there is a class `Building.StructuralMember` which has 2 subclasses `Building.Beam` and `Building.Column`, and the `query` parameter is set to `Building.StructuralMember`, then all elements with ECClassIds of `Building.StructuralMember`, `Building.Beam`, and `Building.Column` will be selected\r\n- If a class `Building.BeamAspect` inherits from a class `bis.ElementAspect` (is unique or multi aspect) and the `query` parameter is set to `Building.BeamAspect`, then all elements that have a `Building.BeamAspect` attached to them will be selected.

Each GroupProperty defines a column of mapped data.\r\n\r\n### Mapping ECProperties\r\n\r\nGroupProperties define mappings from ECProperties on an iModel to columns. They allow mapping the queried, element, element aspect, or related element properties.\r\n\r\nContent of the columns depend on the `ecProperties` field. The `ecProperties` field is a prioritized array which contains `ECProperty` entities. The closer the `ECProperty` is to the array's start, the higher the priority. The priority of `ECProperty` can be changed by reordering the `ecProperties` array. Reading of the `ecProperties` array stops when a valid value is found. For example, if the `ecProperties` array contains 2 entries and the first entry results in a null or undefined value, it will take the second entry. The value can be undefined if the given ECProperty does not exist. The result column will be filled with a null value if no valid value was found.\r\n\r\nEvaluating `ecProperties` is prioritized by:\r\n\r\n1. Queried properties\r\n2. Element properties\r\n3. Element aspect properties\r\n\r\nHaving queried properties as the highest priority allows for constant or complex values to be added to a mapping.\r\n\r\n`ECProperty` lookup is defined by 3 values - `ECSchemaName`, `ECClassName`, and `ECPropertyName`.\r\n\r\n`ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` are used together to create a ECClassId which is the ECClassId of the current row when selecting a property. Class inheritance is _not_ checked. If the ECClassId of a selected row does not match the `ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` pair, the value for this `ECProperty` is considered undefined. If the formed ECClassId is of an element aspect, the current selected row is an element and there is only 1 instance of that element aspect related to the element, the property lookup is done on the element aspect.\r\n\r\n`ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` are case-insensitive.\r\n\r\n`ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` can be set to a wildcard value `*`.\r\n\r\n- If the value of `ECSchemaName` is `*` and the value of `ECClassName` is `Beam`, then it will match any `Beam` class from any schema (e.g. `Building.Beam`, `Structural.Beam`, etc.)\r\n- If the value of `ECSchemaName` is `Building` and the value of `ECClassName` is `*`, then it will match any class from the schema `Building` (e.g. `Building.Beam`, `Building.CurtainWall`, etc.)\r\n- If values of `ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` are `*`, then it will match any ECClassId (e.g. `Building.Beam`, `Structural.Column`, etc.)\r\n- If either value of `ECSchemaName` or `ECClassName` are `*`, then no element aspect lookup is done\r\n\r\nSet `ECPropertyName` to a property name that you want to select. The value of `ECPropertyName` can also be a path defining how to find a property. The path segments must be separated by a period (`.`). The path can contain the names of:\r\n\r\n- A navigation property\r\n- A struct property\r\n- A string property that happens to contain a string representation of a json object\r\n- A property inside the selected json\r\n\r\nNames of properties are not case sensitive. If json object does not have duplicate property names which only differ in letter casing, then those json properties are not case sensitive. We recommend treating json properties as case sensitive.\r\n\r\n- If `Category` property is a navigation property with a value of `{\"id\":\"0x2000000000b\",\"relClassName\":\"BisCore.GeometricElement3dIsInCategory\"}` and the `ECPropertyName` is set to `Category` or `category`, then the whole value `{\"id\":\"0x2000000000b\",\"relClassName\":\"BisCore.GeometricElement3dIsInCategory\"}` will be selected\r\n- If `Category` property is a navigation property with a value of `{\"id\":\"0x2000000000b\",\"relClassName\":\"BisCore.GeometricElement3dIsInCategory\"}` and the `ECPropertyName` is set to `Category.id`, then only the `id` value `0x2000000000b` will be selected\r\n- If `Category` property is a navigation property and it points to a row that has a property `CodeValue` that we want to select, the `ECPropertyName` should be set to `Category.CodeValue`\r\n- If `Model` property is a navigation property and it points to a row that has a property `JsonProperties` with a value `{\"formatter\":{\"mastUnit\":{\"label\":\"m\"}}}` and we want to select the master unit label, the `ECPropertyName` should be set to `Model.JsonProperties.formatter.mastUnit.label`. The result will be `m`\r\n\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nRequires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `insights:modify`.\r\n\r\nFor more documentation on authorization and how to get access token visit [OAUTH2 Authorization](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/authorization/) page.\r\n\r\n### Authorization\r\n\r\nUser must have `imodels_write` permission(s) assigned at the Project level. iModel specific permissions may also be applied at the iModel level if iModel level permissions are enabled.\r\n\r\nAlternatively the user should be an Organization Administrator for the Organization that owns a given Project or iModel.\r\n\r\nAn Organization Administrator must have at least one of the following roles assigned in User Management: Account Administrator, Co-Administrator, or CONNECT Services Administrator.

They allow mapping the queried, element, element aspect, or related element properties.\r\n\r\nContent of the columns depend on the `ecProperties` field. The `ecProperties` field is a prioritized array which contains `ECProperty` entities. The closer the `ECProperty` is to the array's start, the higher the priority. The priority of `ECProperty` can be changed by reordering the `ecProperties` array. Reading of the `ecProperties` array stops when a valid value is found. For example, if the `ecProperties` array contains 2 entries and the first entry results in a null or undefined value, it will take the second entry. The value can be undefined if the given ECProperty does not exist. The result column will be filled with a null value if no valid value was found.\r\n\r\nEvaluating `ecProperties` is prioritized by:\r\n\r\n1. Queried properties\r\n2. Element properties\r\n3. Element aspect properties\r\n\r\nHaving queried properties as the highest priority allows for constant or complex values to be added to a mapping.\r\n\r\n`ECProperty` lookup is defined by 3 values - `ECSchemaName`, `ECClassName`, and `ECPropertyName`.\r\n\r\n`ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` are used together to create a ECClassId which is the ECClassId of the current row when selecting a property. Class inheritance is _not_ checked. If the ECClassId of a selected row does not match the `ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` pair, the value for this `ECProperty` is considered undefined. If the formed ECClassId is of an element aspect, the current selected row is an element and there is only 1 instance of that element aspect related to the element, the property lookup is done on the element aspect.\r\n\r\n`ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` are case-insensitive.\r\n\r\n`ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` can be set to a wildcard value `*`.\r\n\r\n- If the value of `ECSchemaName` is `*` and the value of `ECClassName` is `Beam`, then it will match any `Beam` class from any schema (e.g. `Building.Beam`, `Structural.Beam`, etc.)\r\n- If the value of `ECSchemaName` is `Building` and the value of `ECClassName` is `*`, then it will match any class from the schema `Building` (e.g. `Building.Beam`, `Building.CurtainWall`, etc.)\r\n- If values of `ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` are `*`, then it will match any ECClassId (e.g. `Building.Beam`, `Structural.Column`, etc.)\r\n- If either value of `ECSchemaName` or `ECClassName` are `*`, then no element aspect lookup is done\r\n\r\nSet `ECPropertyName` to a property name that you want to select. The value of `ECPropertyName` can also be a path defining how to find a property. The path segments must be separated by a period (`.`). The path can contain the names of:\r\n\r\n- A navigation property\r\n- A struct property\r\n- A string property that happens to contain a string representation of a json object\r\n- A property inside the selected json\r\n\r\nNames of properties are not case sensitive. If json object does not have duplicate property names which only differ in letter casing, then those json properties are not case sensitive. We recommend treating json properties as case sensitive.\r\n\r\n- If `Category` property is a navigation property with a value of `{\"id\":\"0x2000000000b\",\"relClassName\":\"BisCore.GeometricElement3dIsInCategory\"}` and the `ECPropertyName` is set to `Category` or `category`, then the whole value `{\"id\":\"0x2000000000b\",\"relClassName\":\"BisCore.GeometricElement3dIsInCategory\"}` will be selected\r\n- If `Category` property is a navigation property with a value of `{\"id\":\"0x2000000000b\",\"relClassName\":\"BisCore.GeometricElement3dIsInCategory\"}` and the `ECPropertyName` is set to `Category.id`, then only the `id` value `0x2000000000b` will be selected\r\n- If `Category` property is a navigation property and it points to a row that has a property `CodeValue` that we want to select, the `ECPropertyName` should be set to `Category.CodeValue`\r\n- If `Model` property is a navigation property and it points to a row that has a property `JsonProperties` with a value `{\"formatter\":{\"mastUnit\":{\"label\":\"m\"}}}` and we want to select the master unit label, the `ECPropertyName` should be set to `Model.JsonProperties.formatter.mastUnit.label`.

They allow mapping the queried, element, element aspect, or related element properties.\r\n\r\nContent of the columns depend on the `ecProperties` field. The `ecProperties` field is a prioritized array which contains `ECProperty` entities. The closer the `ECProperty` is to the array's start, the higher the priority. The priority of `ECProperty` can be changed by reordering the `ecProperties` array. Reading of the `ecProperties` array stops when a valid value is found. For example, if the `ecProperties` array contains 2 entries and the first entry results in a null or undefined value, it will take the second entry. The value can be undefined if the given ECProperty does not exist. The result column will be filled with a null value if no valid value was found.\r\n\r\nEvaluating `ecProperties` is prioritized by:\r\n\r\n1. Queried properties\r\n2. Element properties\r\n3. Element aspect properties\r\n\r\nHaving queried properties as the highest priority allows for constant or complex values to be added to a mapping.\r\n\r\n`ECProperty` lookup is defined by 3 values - `ECSchemaName`, `ECClassName`, and `ECPropertyName`.\r\n\r\n`ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` are used together to create a ECClassId which is the ECClassId of the current row when selecting a property. Class inheritance is _not_ checked. If the ECClassId of a selected row does not match the `ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` pair, the value for this `ECProperty` is considered undefined. If the formed ECClassId is of an element aspect, the current selected row is an element and there is only 1 instance of that element aspect related to the element, the property lookup is done on the element aspect.\r\n\r\n`ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` are case-insensitive.\r\n\r\n`ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` can be set to a wildcard value `*`.\r\n\r\n- If the value of `ECSchemaName` is `*` and the value of `ECClassName` is `Beam`, then it will match any `Beam` class from any schema (e.g. `Building.Beam`, `Structural.Beam`, etc.)\r\n- If the value of `ECSchemaName` is `Building` and the value of `ECClassName` is `*`, then it will match any class from the schema `Building` (e.g. `Building.Beam`, `Building.CurtainWall`, etc.)\r\n- If values of `ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` are `*`, then it will match any ECClassId (e.g. `Building.Beam`, `Structural.Column`, etc.)\r\n- If either value of `ECSchemaName` or `ECClassName` are `*`, then no element aspect lookup is done\r\n\r\nSet `ECPropertyName` to a property name that you want to select. The value of `ECPropertyName` can also be a path defining how to find a property. The path segments must be separated by a period (`.`). The path can contain the names of:\r\n\r\n- A navigation property\r\n- A struct property\r\n- A string property that happens to contain a string representation of a json object\r\n- A property inside the selected json\r\n\r\nNames of properties are not case sensitive. If json object does not have duplicate property names which only differ in letter casing, then those json properties are not case sensitive. We recommend treating json properties as case sensitive.\r\n\r\n- If `Category` property is a navigation property with a value of `{\"id\":\"0x2000000000b\",\"relClassName\":\"BisCore.GeometricElement3dIsInCategory\"}` and the `ECPropertyName` is set to `Category` or `category`, then the whole value `{\"id\":\"0x2000000000b\",\"relClassName\":\"BisCore.GeometricElement3dIsInCategory\"}` will be selected\r\n- If `Category` property is a navigation property with a value of `{\"id\":\"0x2000000000b\",\"relClassName\":\"BisCore.GeometricElement3dIsInCategory\"}` and the `ECPropertyName` is set to `Category.id`, then only the `id` value `0x2000000000b` will be selected\r\n- If `Category` property is a navigation property and it points to a row that has a property `CodeValue` that we want to select, the `ECPropertyName` should be set to `Category.CodeValue`\r\n- If `Model` property is a navigation property and it points to a row that has a property `JsonProperties` with a value `{\"formatter\":{\"mastUnit\":{\"label\":\"m\"}}}` and we want to select the master unit label, the `ECPropertyName` should be set to `Model.JsonProperties.formatter.mastUnit.label`. The result will be `m`\r\n\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nRequires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `insights:read`.\r\n\r\nFor more documentation on authorization and how to get access token visit [OAUTH2 Authorization](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/authorization/) page.\r\n\r\n### Authorization\r\n\r\nUser must have `imodels_read` permission(s) assigned at the Project level. iModel specific permissions may also be applied at the iModel level if iModel level permissions are enabled.\r\n\r\nAlternatively the user should be an Organization Administrator for the Organization that owns a given Project or iModel.\r\n\r\nAn Organization Administrator must have at least one of the following roles assigned in User Management: Account Administrator, Co-Administrator, or CONNECT Services Administrator.

CustomCalculation defines a column in the output data which gets filled with a result of the formula evaluation. The formula is evaluated during each extraction for each row of the Group's query result.\r\n\r\nThe formula supports using other columns (GroupProperty, CalculatedProperty or CustomCalculation entities) as variables. Recursive formulas are not supported, i.e., formula containing a variable `X` is not supported inside a CustomCalculation with a `propertyName` equal to `X`.\r\n\r\nSupported operators:\r\n\r\n- Unary `-` (negation) has a precedence of 5 and right associativity\r\n- `**` (exponentiation) has a precedence of 4 and right associativity\r\n- `*` (multiplication) has a precedence of 3 and left associativity\r\n- `/` (division) has a precedence of 3 and left associativity\r\n- `%` (remainder) has a precedence of 3 and left associativity\r\n- `+` (addition) has a precedence of 2 and left associativity\r\n- Binary `-` (subtraction) has a precedence of 2 and left associativity\r\n\r\nParenthesis `(` and `)` can be used to change the precedence of operations. Variables, constants, and functions have a precedence of 1 and left associativity.\r\n\r\nSupported constants:\r\n\r\n- `E` - Euler's constant and the base of natural logarithms (approx. 2.718)\r\n- `LN2` - natural logarithm of 2 (approx. 0.693)\r\n- `LN10` - natural logarithm of 10 (approx. 2.303)\r\n- `LOG2E` - base-2 logarithm of `E` (approx. 1.443)\r\n- `PI` - ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter (approx. 3.14159)\r\n- `SQRT1_2` - square root of ½ (approx. 0.707)\r\n- `SQRT2` - square root of 2 (approx. 1.414)\r\n\r\nSupported numeric constant formats:\r\n\r\n- Decimal, e.g., `123` or `1.123`\r\n- Binary (base 2), e.g., `0b1010`\r\n- Octal (base 8), e.g., `0o1234567`\r\n- Hexadecimal (base 16), e.g., `0x123af`\r\n- Scientific notation, e.g., `1.123e+3`\r\n\r\nSupported functions:\r\n\r\n- `abs(x)` - returns the absolute value of `x`\r\n- `acos(x)` - returns the arccosine of `x`\r\n- `acosh(x)` - returns the hyperbolic arccosine of `x`\r\n- `asin(x)` - returns the arcsine of `x`\r\n- `asinh(x)` - returns the hyperbolic arcsine of `x`\r\n- `atan(x)` - returns the arctangent of `x`\r\n- `atanh(x)` - returns the hyperbolic arctangent of `x`\r\n- `atan2(y, x)` - returns the arctangent of the quotient of `y` divided by `x`\r\n- `cbrt(x)` - returns the cube root of `x`\r\n- `ceil(x)` - returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x`\r\n- `clz32(x)` - returns the number of leading zero bits of the 32-bit integer `x`\r\n- `cos(x)` - returns the cosine of `x`\r\n- `cosh(x)` - returns the hyperbolic cosine of `x`\r\n- `exp(x)` - returns `E ** x` or `pow(E, x)`, where `x` is the argument, and `E` is Euler's constant (2.718…, the base of the natural logarithm)\r\n- `expm1(x)` - returns subtracting 1 from `exp(x)`\r\n- `floor(x)` - returns the largest integer less than or equal to `x`\r\n- `fround(x)` - returns the nearest single precision float representation of `x`\r\n- `hypot(x, y[, z[, …]])` - returns the square root of the sum of squares of its arguments\r\n- `imul(x, y)` - returns the result of the 32-bit integer multiplication of `x` and `y`\r\n- `log(x)` - returns the natural logarithm of `x`\r\n- `log1p(x)` - returns the natural logarithm of `1 + x`\r\n- `log10(x)` - returns the base-10 logarithm of `x`\r\n- `log2(x)` - returns the base-2 logarithm of `x`\r\n- `max(x, y[, z[, …]])` - returns the largest of 2 or more numbers\r\n- `min(x, y[, z[, …]])` - returns the smallest of 2 or more numbers\r\n- `pow(x, y)` - returns base `x` to the exponent power `y` (i.e., `x**y`)\r\n- `random()` - returns a pseudo-random number between 0 and 1. The value only changes between different output tables. All rows within a single output table get the same value\r\n- `round(x)` - returns the value of the number `x` rounded to the nearest integer\r\n- `sign(x)` - returns the sign of the `x`, indicating whether `x` is positive (`1`), negative (`-1`), or zero (`0`)\r\n- `sin(x)` - returns the sine of `x`\r\n- `sinh(x)` - returns the hyperbolic sine of `x`\r\n- `sqrt(x)` - returns the positive square root of `x`\r\n- `tan(x)` - returns the tangent of `x`\r\n- `tanh(x)` - returns the hyperbolic tangent of `x`\r\n- `trunc(x)` - returns the integer portion of `x`, removing any fractional digits\r\n\r\nExamples of supported formulas:\r\n\r\n- `min(A * B, B * C, A * C)` - if `A`, `B`, and `C` are 3 different lengths of box edges, then this formula will result in the smallest side surface area of that box\r\n- `min * max` - formula does not have parenthesis after function names, so the `min` and `max` operands are treated as variables (other columns), not as functions. If the Group has columns `min` and `max`, and their values are `2` and `5`, then the result of this formula is `10` for that row\r\n- `2 ** 3` - 2 raised to the power of 3. Result will be 8. This can also be written as `pow(2, 3)`\r\n- `min(cos(X), sin(X))` - function nesting is supported\r\n- `A * (B + C)` - `A` multiplied by the sum of `B` and `C`\r\n- `A * B + C` - same as `(A * B) + C`\r\n\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nRequires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `insights:modify`.\r\n\r\nFor more documentation on authorization and how to get access token visit [OAUTH2 Authorization](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/authorization/) page.\r\n\r\n### Authorization\r\n\r\nUser must have `imodels_write` permission(s) assigned at the Project level. iModel specific permissions may also be applied at the iModel level if iModel level permissions are enabled.\r\n\r\nAlternatively the user should be an Organization Administrator for the Organization that owns a given Project or iModel.\r\n\r\nAn Organization Administrator must have at least one of the following roles assigned in User Management: Account Administrator, Co-Administrator, or CONNECT Services Administrator.

They allow mapping the queried, element, element aspect, or related element properties.\r\n\r\nContent of the columns depend on the `ecProperties` field. The `ecProperties` field is a prioritized array which contains `ECProperty` entities. The closer the `ECProperty` is to the array's start, the higher the priority. The priority of `ECProperty` can be changed by reordering the `ecProperties` array. Reading of the `ecProperties` array stops when a valid value is found. For example, if the `ecProperties` array contains 2 entries and the first entry results in a null or undefined value, it will take the second entry. The value can be undefined if the given ECProperty does not exist. The result column will be filled with a null value if no valid value was found.\r\n\r\nEvaluating `ecProperties` is prioritized by:\r\n\r\n1. Queried properties\r\n2. Element properties\r\n3. Element aspect properties\r\n\r\nHaving queried properties as the highest priority allows for constant or complex values to be added to a mapping.\r\n\r\n`ECProperty` lookup is defined by 3 values - `ECSchemaName`, `ECClassName`, and `ECPropertyName`.\r\n\r\n`ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` are used together to create a ECClassId which is the ECClassId of the current row when selecting a property. Class inheritance is _not_ checked. If the ECClassId of a selected row does not match the `ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` pair, the value for this `ECProperty` is considered undefined. If the formed ECClassId is of an element aspect, the current selected row is an element and there is only 1 instance of that element aspect related to the element, the property lookup is done on the element aspect.\r\n\r\n`ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` are case-insensitive.\r\n\r\n`ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` can be set to a wildcard value `*`.\r\n\r\n- If the value of `ECSchemaName` is `*` and the value of `ECClassName` is `Beam`, then it will match any `Beam` class from any schema (e.g. `Building.Beam`, `Structural.Beam`, etc.)\r\n- If the value of `ECSchemaName` is `Building` and the value of `ECClassName` is `*`, then it will match any class from the schema `Building` (e.g. `Building.Beam`, `Building.CurtainWall`, etc.)\r\n- If values of `ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` are `*`, then it will match any ECClassId (e.g. `Building.Beam`, `Structural.Column`, etc.)\r\n- If either value of `ECSchemaName` or `ECClassName` are `*`, then no element aspect lookup is done\r\n\r\nSet `ECPropertyName` to a property name that you want to select. The value of `ECPropertyName` can also be a path defining how to find a property. The path segments must be separated by a period (`.`). The path can contain the names of:\r\n\r\n- A navigation property\r\n- A struct property\r\n- A string property that happens to contain a string representation of a json object\r\n- A property inside the selected json\r\n\r\nNames of properties are not case sensitive. If json object does not have duplicate property names which only differ in letter casing, then those json properties are not case sensitive. We recommend treating json properties as case sensitive.\r\n\r\n- If `Category` property is a navigation property with a value of `{\"id\":\"0x2000000000b\",\"relClassName\":\"BisCore.GeometricElement3dIsInCategory\"}` and the `ECPropertyName` is set to `Category` or `category`, then the whole value `{\"id\":\"0x2000000000b\",\"relClassName\":\"BisCore.GeometricElement3dIsInCategory\"}` will be selected\r\n- If `Category` property is a navigation property with a value of `{\"id\":\"0x2000000000b\",\"relClassName\":\"BisCore.GeometricElement3dIsInCategory\"}` and the `ECPropertyName` is set to `Category.id`, then only the `id` value `0x2000000000b` will be selected\r\n- If `Category` property is a navigation property and it points to a row that has a property `CodeValue` that we want to select, the `ECPropertyName` should be set to `Category.CodeValue`\r\n- If `Model` property is a navigation property and it points to a row that has a property `JsonProperties` with a value `{\"formatter\":{\"mastUnit\":{\"label\":\"m\"}}}` and we want to select the master unit label, the `ECPropertyName` should be set to `Model.JsonProperties.formatter.mastUnit.label`. The result will be `m`\r\n\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nRequires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `insights:modify`.\r\n\r\nFor more documentation on authorization and how to get access token visit [OAUTH2 Authorization](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/authorization/) page.\r\n\r\n### Authorization\r\n\r\nUser must have `imodels_write` permission(s) assigned at the Project level. iModel specific permissions may also be applied at the iModel level if iModel level permissions are enabled.\r\n\r\nAlternatively the user should be an Organization Administrator for the Organization that owns a given Project or iModel.\r\n\r\nAn Organization Administrator must have at least one of the following roles assigned in User Management: Account Administrator, Co-Administrator, or CONNECT Services Administrator.
