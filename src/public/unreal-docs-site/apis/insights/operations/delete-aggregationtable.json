AggregationProperty","description":"---\r\n\r\nCreates an aggregation property.\r\n\r\nAggregation property defines how the aggregation should be done. There are 3 supported types: `GroupBy`, `Count`, and `Sum`.\r\n\r\n`GroupBy` aggregation property type splits the data source table into groups that have matching values in the column specified in `sourcePropertyName`. If you will not create a `GroupBy` property our aggregator will assume that the whole data source table is one group. If you will create multiple `GroupBy` properties targeting different data source properties each group will have a unique combination of those properties. See example configuration and output table `T3` below.\r\n\r\n`Count` aggregation property type counts how many rows there are in a group. If the value of property specified in `sourcePropertyName` contains a `null` value in data source table, the row is still counted.\r\n\r\n`Sum` aggregation property type sums all values of a single property in a single group.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nLet's say you have this data source table:\r\n\r\n| A | B | C | D |\r\n|--|--|--|--|\r\n| a1 | b1 | 1 | null |\r\n| a1 | b2 | 2 | 1 |\r\n| a2 | b2 | 4 | 2 |\r\n| a2 | b2 | 8 | 4 |\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThen you have these aggregation table configurations:\r\n\r\n- Aggregation properties for table `T1`:\r\n\r\n| propertyName | sourcePropertyName | type |\r\n|--|--|--|\r\n| CountC | C | Count |\r\n| CountD | D | Count |\r\n| SumC | C | Sum |\r\n| SumD | D | Sum |\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n- Aggregation properties for table `T2`:\r\n\r\n| propertyName | sourcePropertyName | type |\r\n|--|--|--|\r\n| GroupA | A | GroupBy |\r\n| SumC | C | Sum |\r\n| CountC | C | Count |\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n- Aggregation properties for table `T3`:\r\n\r\n| propertyName | sourcePropertyName | type |\r\n|--|--|--|\r\n| GroupA | A | GroupBy |\r\n| GroupB | B | GroupBy |\r\n| SumC | C | Sum |\r\n| CountC | C | Count |\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThen your aggregated table outputs will look like this:\r\n\r\n- Table `T1`:\r\n\r\n| CountC | CountD | SumC | SumD |\r\n|--|--|--|--|\r\n| 4 | 4 | 15 | 7 |\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n- Table `T2`:\r\n\r\n| GroupA | SumC | CountC |\r\n|--|--|--|\r\n| a1 | 3 | 2 |\r\n| a2 | 12 | 2 |\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n- Table `T3`:\r\n\r\n| GroupA | GroupB | SumC | CountC |\r\n|--|--|--|--|\r\n| a1 | b1 | 1 | 1 |\r\n| a1 | b2 | 2 | 1 |\r\n| a2 | b2 | 12 | 2 |\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn the `T3` example you can see that groups were created for each unique pair of values in columns `A` and `B`.\r\n\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nRequires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `itwin-platform`.\r\n\r\nFor more documentation on authorization and how to get access token visit [OAUTH2 Authorization](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/authorization/) page.\r\n\r\n### Authorization\r\n\r\nUser must have `imodels_write` permission(s) assigned at the Project level. iModel specific permissions may also be applied at the iModel level if iModel level permissions are enabled.\r\n\r\nAlternatively the user should be an Organization Administrator for the Organization that owns a given Project or iModel.\r\n\r\nAn Organization Administrator must have at least one of the following roles assigned in User Management: Account Administrator, Co-Administrator, or CONNECT Services Administrator.

There are 3 supported types: `GroupBy`, `Count`, and `Sum`.\r\n\r\n`GroupBy` aggregation property type splits the data source table into groups that have matching values in the column specified in `sourcePropertyName`. If you will not create a `GroupBy` property our aggregator will assume that the whole data source table is one group. If you will create multiple `GroupBy` properties targeting different data source properties each group will have a unique combination of those properties. See example configuration and output table `T3` below.\r\n\r\n`Count` aggregation property type counts how many rows there are in a group.

There are 3 supported types: `GroupBy`, `Count`, and `Sum`.\r\n\r\n`GroupBy` aggregation property type splits the data source table into groups that have matching values in the column specified in `sourcePropertyName`. If you will not create a `GroupBy` property our aggregator will assume that the whole data source table is one group. If you will create multiple `GroupBy` properties targeting different data source properties each group will have a unique combination of those properties. See example configuration and output table `T3` below.\r\n\r\n`Count` aggregation property type counts how many rows there are in a group. If the value of property specified in `sourcePropertyName` contains a `null` value in data source table, the row is still counted.\r\n\r\n`Sum` aggregation property type sums all values of a single property in a single group.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nLet's say you have this data source table:\r\n\r\n| A | B | C | D |\r\n|--|--|--|--|\r\n| a1 | b1 | 1 | null |\r\n| a1 | b2 | 2 | 1 |\r\n| a2 | b2 | 4 | 2 |\r\n| a2 | b2 | 8 | 4 |\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThen you have these aggregation table configurations:\r\n\r\n- Aggregation properties for table `T1`:\r\n\r\n| propertyName | sourcePropertyName | type |\r\n|--|--|--|\r\n| CountC | C | Count |\r\n| CountD | D | Count |\r\n| SumC | C | Sum |\r\n| SumD | D | Sum |\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n- Aggregation properties for table `T2`:\r\n\r\n| propertyName | sourcePropertyName | type |\r\n|--|--|--|\r\n| GroupA | A | GroupBy |\r\n| SumC | C | Sum |\r\n| CountC | C | Count |\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n- Aggregation properties for table `T3`:\r\n\r\n| propertyName | sourcePropertyName | type |\r\n|--|--|--|\r\n| GroupA | A | GroupBy |\r\n| GroupB | B | GroupBy |\r\n| SumC | C | Sum |\r\n| CountC | C | Count |\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThen your aggregated table outputs will look like this:\r\n\r\n- Table `T1`:\r\n\r\n| CountC | CountD | SumC | SumD |\r\n|--|--|--|--|\r\n| 4 | 4 | 15 | 7 |\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n- Table `T2`:\r\n\r\n| GroupA | SumC | CountC |\r\n|--|--|--|\r\n| a1 | 3 | 2 |\r\n| a2 | 12 | 2 |\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n- Table `T3`:\r\n\r\n| GroupA | GroupB | SumC | CountC |\r\n|--|--|--|--|\r\n| a1 | b1 | 1 | 1 |\r\n| a1 | b2 | 2 | 1 |\r\n| a2 | b2 | 12 | 2 |\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn the `T3` example you can see that groups were created for each unique pair of values in columns `A` and `B`.\r\n\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nRequires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `itwin-platform`.\r\n\r\nFor more documentation on authorization and how to get access token visit [OAUTH2 Authorization](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/authorization/) page.\r\n\r\n### Authorization\r\n\r\nUser must have `imodels_write` permission(s) assigned at the Project level. iModel specific permissions may also be applied at the iModel level if iModel level permissions are enabled.\r\n\r\nAlternatively the user should be an Organization Administrator for the Organization that owns a given Project or iModel.\r\n\r\nAn Organization Administrator must have at least one of the following roles assigned in User Management: Account Administrator, Co-Administrator, or CONNECT Services Administrator.

Then the final formula result is the addition of the result of `ifnullorempty` function and variable `B`\r\n- `if(A != null && B != null, A + B, 0)` - if `A` is not null and `B` is not null then the result is the addition of `A` and `B` else it is `0`\r\n\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nRequires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `itwin-platform`.\r\n\r\nFor more documentation on authorization and how to get access token visit [OAUTH2 Authorization](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/authorization/) page.\r\n\r\n### Authorization\r\n\r\nUser must have `imodels_write` permission(s) assigned at the Project level. iModel specific permissions may also be applied at the iModel level if iModel level permissions are enabled.\r\n\r\nAlternatively the user should be an Organization Administrator for the Organization that owns a given Project or iModel.\r\n\r\nAn Organization Administrator must have at least one of the following roles assigned in User Management: Account Administrator, Co-Administrator, or CONNECT Services Administrator.

If only `ECInstanceId` and `ECClassId` are selected and other columns are used for mapping, those columns will be filled with `null` values. If either `ECInstanceId` or `ECClassId` column is not selected, the query will not produce any output.\r\n\r\nIf the `query` parameter does not contain a valid ECSql query, then it must be equal to `bis.Element`, `bis.ElementAspect`, or any of their descendants.\r\n\r\nThe ECClassId format `{schemaName}:{schemaItemName}` where `schemaName` does not contain a 3-part version number is supported.\r\n\r\nThe ECClassId format `{schemaName}.{schemaItemName}` is supported.\r\n\r\nThe ECClassId format `{schemaAlias}:{schemaItemName}` where `schemaAlias` is the alias of a `schemaName` is supported.\r\n\r\nThe ECClassId format `{schemaFullName}:{schemaItemName}` where `schemaFullName` contains a 3-part version number is _not_ supported.\r\n\r\nWhen the given ECClassId is equal to `bis.Element` or is one of its descendants, then all elements with the ECClassId will be selected.\r\n\r\nWhen the given ECClassId is equal to `bis.ElementAspect` or is one of its descendants, then all elements that have such aspect will be selected.\r\n\r\nWhen the given ECClassId is none of the above, the query will not produce any output.\r\n\r\n- If a class `Building.Beam` does not have any subclasses and the `query` parameter is set to `Building.Beam`, then all elements with ECClassIds of `Building.Beam` will be selected\r\n- If there is a class `Building.StructuralMember` which has 2 subclasses `Building.Beam` and `Building.Column`, and the `query` parameter is set to `Building.StructuralMember`, then all elements with ECClassIds of `Building.StructuralMember`, `Building.Beam`, and `Building.Column` will be selected\r\n- If a class `Building.BeamAspect` inherits from a class `bis.ElementAspect` (is unique or multi aspect) and the `query` parameter is set to `Building.BeamAspect`, then all elements that have a `Building.BeamAspect` attached to them will be selected. This query will _not_ select the aspects themselves, but the elements that they are attached to. The selected elements may have any ECClassId\r\n- If there is class `Building.StructuralMemberAspect` which has 2 subclasses `Building.BeamAspect` and `Building.ColumnAspect`, the `Building.StructuralMemberAspect` class inherits from a class `bis.ElementAspect` (is unique or multi aspect) and the `query` parameter is set to `Building.StructuralMemberAspect`, then all elements that have `Building.StructuralMemberAspect`, `Building.BeamAspect`, or `Building.ColumnAspect` attached to them will be selected. This query will _not_ select the aspects themselves, but the elements that they are attached to. The selected elements may have any ECClassId\r\n\r\nIf different queries are needed for a single output table, then create multiple Groups with those different queries but with the same name for each Group. That will cause results of all these queries to be concatenated into a single output table. The output table will have column list equal to a union of all GroupProperties of Groups with the same name.\r\n\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nRequires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `itwin-platform`.\r\n\r\nFor more documentation on authorization and how to get access token visit [OAUTH2 Authorization](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/authorization/) page.\r\n\r\n### Authorization\r\n\r\nUser must have `imodels_write` permission(s) assigned at the Project level. iModel specific permissions may also be applied at the iModel level if iModel level permissions are enabled.\r\n\r\nAlternatively the user should be an Organization Administrator for the Organization that owns a given Project or iModel.\r\n\r\nAn Organization Administrator must have at least one of the following roles assigned in User Management: Account Administrator, Co-Administrator, or CONNECT Services Administrator.

Each GroupProperty defines a column of mapped data.\r\n\r\n### Mapping ECProperties\r\n\r\nGroupProperties define mappings from ECProperties on an iModel to columns. They allow mapping the queried, element, element aspect, or related element properties.\r\n\r\nContent of the columns depend on the `ecProperties` field. The `ecProperties` field is a prioritized array which contains `ECProperty` entities. The closer the `ECProperty` is to the array's start, the higher the priority. The priority of `ECProperty` can be changed by reordering the `ecProperties` array. Reading of the `ecProperties` array stops when a valid value is found. For example, if the `ecProperties` array contains two entries and the first entry results in a null or undefined value, it will take the second entry. The value can be undefined if the given ECProperty does not exist. The result column will be filled with a null value if no valid value was found.\r\n\r\nEvaluating `ecProperties` is prioritized by:\r\n\r\n1. Queried properties\r\n2. Element properties\r\n3. Element aspect properties\r\n\r\nHaving queried properties as the highest priority allows for constant or complex values to be added to a mapping.\r\n\r\n`ECProperty` lookup is defined by four values - `ECSchemaName`, `ECClassName`, `ECPropertyName` and `ECPropertyType`.\r\n\r\n`ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` are used together to create a ECClassId which is the ECClassId of the current row when selecting a property. If the ECClassId of a selected row does not match the `ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` pair, the value for this `ECProperty` is considered undefined. If the formed ECClassId is of an element aspect, the current selected row is an element and there is only one instance of that element aspect related to the element, the property lookup is done on the element aspect.\r\n\r\n`ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` are case-insensitive.\r\n\r\n`ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` can be set to a wildcard value `*`.\r\n\r\n- If the value of `ECSchemaName` is `*` and the value of `ECClassName` is `Beam`, then it will match any `Beam` class from any schema (e.g. `Building.Beam`, `Structural.Beam`, etc.)\r\n- If the value of `ECSchemaName` is `Building` and the value of `ECClassName` is `*`, then it will match any class from the schema `Building` (e.g. `Building.Beam`, `Building.CurtainWall`, etc.)\r\n- If values of `ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` are `*`, then it will match any ECClassId (e.g. `Building.Beam`, `Structural.Column`, etc.)\r\n- If either value of `ECSchemaName` or `ECClassName` are `*`, then no element aspect lookup is done\r\n\r\nClass inheritance is checked if there is no wildcard value.\r\n\r\n- If the value of `ECSchemaName` is `Building` and the value of `ECClassName` is `StructuralMember`, then it will match any ECClassId which inherits `Building.StructuralMember` (e.g. `Building.Beam` which inherits `Building.StructuralMember`, `Building.Column` which inherits `Building.StructuralMember`, etc)\r\n- If `ECSchemaName` or `ECClassName` is a wildcard, then inheritance will not be checked\r\n\r\nSet `ECPropertyName` to a property name that you want to select. The value of `ECPropertyName` can also be a path defining how to find a property. The path segments must be separated by a period (`.`). The path can contain the names of:\r\n\r\n- A navigation property\r\n- A struct property\r\n- A string property that happens to contain a string representation of a json object\r\n- A property inside the selected json\r\n\r\nNames of properties are not case sensitive. If json object does not have duplicate property names which only differ in letter casing, then those json properties are not case sensitive. We recommend treating json properties as case sensitive.\r\n\r\n- If `Category` property is a navigation property with a value of `{\"id\":\"0x2000000000b\",\"relClassName\":\"BisCore.GeometricElement3dIsInCategory\"}` and the `ECPropertyName` is set to `Category` or `category`, then the whole value `{\"id\":\"0x2000000000b\",\"relClassName\":\"BisCore.GeometricElement3dIsInCategory\"}` will be selected\r\n- If `Category` property is a navigation property with a value of `{\"id\":\"0x2000000000b\",\"relClassName\":\"BisCore.GeometricElement3dIsInCategory\"}` and the `ECPropertyName` is set to `Category.id`, then only the `id` value `0x2000000000b` will be selected\r\n- If `Category` property is a navigation property and it points to a row that has a property `CodeValue` that we want to select, the `ECPropertyName` should be set to `Category.CodeValue`\r\n- If `Model` property is a navigation property and it points to a row that has a property `JsonProperties` with a value `{\"formatter\":{\"mastUnit\":{\"label\":\"m\"}}}` and we want to select the master unit label, the `ECPropertyName` should be set to `Model.JsonProperties.formatter.mastUnit.label`. The result will be `m`\r\n\r\n`ECPropertyType` is case sensitive and corresponds to the data type of a `ECProperty` you want to select. Supported Type values are:\r\n\r\n- `Boolean` - describes a logical value which is either true or false,\r\n- `Number` - treated the same as Double,\r\n- `Integer` - describes a whole number,\r\n- `Double` - describes a real number,\r\n- `String` - describes text.\r\n\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nRequires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `itwin-platform`.\r\n\r\nFor more documentation on authorization and how to get access token visit [OAUTH2 Authorization](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/authorization/) page.\r\n\r\n### Authorization\r\n\r\nUser must have `imodels_write` permission(s) assigned at the Project level. iModel specific permissions may also be applied at the iModel level if iModel level permissions are enabled.\r\n\r\nAlternatively the user should be an Organization Administrator for the Organization that owns a given Project or iModel.\r\n\r\nAn Organization Administrator must have at least one of the following roles assigned in User Management: Account Administrator, Co-Administrator, or CONNECT Services Administrator.

Then the final formula result is the addition of the result of `ifnullorempty` function and variable `B`\r\n- `if(A != null && B != null, A + B, 0)` - if `A` is not null and `B` is not null then the result is the addition of `A` and `B` else it is `0`\r\n\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nRequires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `itwin-platform`.\r\n\r\nFor more documentation on authorization and how to get access token visit [OAUTH2 Authorization](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/authorization/) page.\r\n\r\n### Authorization\r\n\r\nUser must have `imodels_read` permission(s) assigned at the Project level. iModel specific permissions may also be applied at the iModel level if iModel level permissions are enabled.\r\n\r\nAlternatively the user should be an Organization Administrator for the Organization that owns a given Project or iModel.\r\n\r\nAn Organization Administrator must have at least one of the following roles assigned in User Management: Account Administrator, Co-Administrator, or CONNECT Services Administrator.

Recursive formulas are not supported, i.e., formula containing a variable `X` is not supported inside a CustomCalculation with a `propertyName` equal to `X`.\r\n\r\nSupported data types:\r\n\r\n- Number - describes a real number. When converted to a boolean value in logical operators `0` becomes `false` and all other values become `true`\r\n- Boolean - describes a logical value which is either true or false. When converted to a number in certain operators `true` becomes `1` and `false` becomes `0`\r\n- String - describes text. When converted to a boolean value in logical operators an empty string becomes `false` and all other strings become `true`\r\n\r\nAll of the supported data types can have no value which means that the value is `null`. Some operations support `null` values but those which do not will return `null` as the result.\r\n\r\nSupported operators:\r\n\r\n| Symbol | Name | Precedence | Associativity | Operand Types | Can receive null | Result |\r\n|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n| Unary `-` | Unary negation | 9 | Right | Numbers and booleans | No | Number |\r\n| `!` | Logical not | 9 | Right | All data types | No | Boolean |\r\n| `**` | Exponentiation | 8 | Right | Numbers and booleans | No | Number |\r\n| `*` | Multiplication | 7 | Left | Numbers and booleans | No | Number |\r\n| `/` | Division | 7 | Left | Numbers and booleans | No | Number |\r\n| `%` | Remainder | 7 | Left | Numbers and booleans | No | Number |\r\n| `+` | Addition | 6 | Left | All data types | No | Number or string if one of the operands is a string |\r\n| Binary `-` | Subtraction | 6 | Left | Numbers and booleans | No | Number |\r\n| `<` | Less than | 5 | Left | All data types | No | Boolean |\r\n| `<=` | Less than or equal | 5 | Left | All data types | No | Boolean |\r\n| `>` | Greater than | 5 | Left | All data types | No | Boolean |\r\n| `>=` | Greater than or equal | 5 | Left | All data types | No | Boolean |\r\n| `==` | Equality | 4 | Left | All data types | Yes | Boolean |\r\n| `!=` | Inequality | 4 | Left | All data types | Yes | Boolean |\r\n| `&&` | Logical and | 3 | Left | All data types | No | Boolean |\r\n| `\\|\\|` | Logical or | 2 | Left | All data types | No | Boolean |\r\n\r\nParenthesis `(` and `)` can be used to change the precedence of operations.

Then the final formula result is the addition of the result of `ifnullorempty` function and variable `B`\r\n- `if(A != null && B != null, A + B, 0)` - if `A` is not null and `B` is not null then the result is the addition of `A` and `B` else it is `0`\r\n\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nRequires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `itwin-platform`.\r\n\r\nFor more documentation on authorization and how to get access token visit [OAUTH2 Authorization](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/authorization/) page.\r\n\r\n### Authorization\r\n\r\nUser must have `imodels_read` permission(s) assigned at the Project level. iModel specific permissions may also be applied at the iModel level if iModel level permissions are enabled.\r\n\r\nAlternatively the user should be an Organization Administrator for the Organization that owns a given Project or iModel.\r\n\r\nAn Organization Administrator must have at least one of the following roles assigned in User Management: Account Administrator, Co-Administrator, or CONNECT Services Administrator.

Then the final formula result is the addition of the result of `ifnullorempty` function and variable `B`\r\n- `if(A != null && B != null, A + B, 0)` - if `A` is not null and `B` is not null then the result is the addition of `A` and `B` else it is `0`\r\n\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nRequires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `itwin-platform`.\r\n\r\nFor more documentation on authorization and how to get access token visit [OAUTH2 Authorization](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/authorization/) page.\r\n\r\n### Authorization\r\n\r\nUser must have `imodels_write` permission(s) assigned at the Project level. iModel specific permissions may also be applied at the iModel level if iModel level permissions are enabled.\r\n\r\nAlternatively the user should be an Organization Administrator for the Organization that owns a given Project or iModel.\r\n\r\nAn Organization Administrator must have at least one of the following roles assigned in User Management: Account Administrator, Co-Administrator, or CONNECT Services Administrator.

They allow mapping the queried, element, element aspect, or related element properties.\r\n\r\nContent of the columns depend on the `ecProperties` field. The `ecProperties` field is a prioritized array which contains `ECProperty` entities. The closer the `ECProperty` is to the array's start, the higher the priority. The priority of `ECProperty` can be changed by reordering the `ecProperties` array. Reading of the `ecProperties` array stops when a valid value is found. For example, if the `ecProperties` array contains two entries and the first entry results in a null or undefined value, it will take the second entry. The value can be undefined if the given ECProperty does not exist. The result column will be filled with a null value if no valid value was found.\r\n\r\nEvaluating `ecProperties` is prioritized by:\r\n\r\n1. Queried properties\r\n2. Element properties\r\n3. Element aspect properties\r\n\r\nHaving queried properties as the highest priority allows for constant or complex values to be added to a mapping.\r\n\r\n`ECProperty` lookup is defined by four values - `ECSchemaName`, `ECClassName`, `ECPropertyName` and `ECPropertyType`.\r\n\r\n`ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` are used together to create a ECClassId which is the ECClassId of the current row when selecting a property. If the ECClassId of a selected row does not match the `ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` pair, the value for this `ECProperty` is considered undefined. If the formed ECClassId is of an element aspect, the current selected row is an element and there is only one instance of that element aspect related to the element, the property lookup is done on the element aspect.\r\n\r\n`ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` are case-insensitive.\r\n\r\n`ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` can be set to a wildcard value `*`.\r\n\r\n- If the value of `ECSchemaName` is `*` and the value of `ECClassName` is `Beam`, then it will match any `Beam` class from any schema (e.g. `Building.Beam`, `Structural.Beam`, etc.)\r\n- If the value of `ECSchemaName` is `Building` and the value of `ECClassName` is `*`, then it will match any class from the schema `Building` (e.g. `Building.Beam`, `Building.CurtainWall`, etc.)\r\n- If values of `ECSchemaName` and `ECClassName` are `*`, then it will match any ECClassId (e.g. `Building.Beam`, `Structural.Column`, etc.)\r\n- If either value of `ECSchemaName` or `ECClassName` are `*`, then no element aspect lookup is done\r\n\r\nClass inheritance is checked if there is no wildcard value.\r\n\r\n- If the value of `ECSchemaName` is `Building` and the value of `ECClassName` is `StructuralMember`, then it will match any ECClassId which inherits `Building.StructuralMember` (e.g. `Building.Beam` which inherits `Building.StructuralMember`, `Building.Column` which inherits `Building.StructuralMember`, etc)\r\n- If `ECSchemaName` or `ECClassName` is a wildcard, then inheritance will not be checked\r\n\r\nSet `ECPropertyName` to a property name that you want to select. The value of `ECPropertyName` can also be a path defining how to find a property. The path segments must be separated by a period (`.`). The path can contain the names of:\r\n\r\n- A navigation property\r\n- A struct property\r\n- A string property that happens to contain a string representation of a json object\r\n- A property inside the selected json\r\n\r\nNames of properties are not case sensitive. If json object does not have duplicate property names which only differ in letter casing, then those json properties are not case sensitive. We recommend treating json properties as case sensitive.\r\n\r\n- If `Category` property is a navigation property with a value of `{\"id\":\"0x2000000000b\",\"relClassName\":\"BisCore.GeometricElement3dIsInCategory\"}` and the `ECPropertyName` is set to `Category` or `category`, then the whole value `{\"id\":\"0x2000000000b\",\"relClassName\":\"BisCore.GeometricElement3dIsInCategory\"}` will be selected\r\n- If `Category` property is a navigation property with a value of `{\"id\":\"0x2000000000b\",\"relClassName\":\"BisCore.GeometricElement3dIsInCategory\"}` and the `ECPropertyName` is set to `Category.id`, then only the `id` value `0x2000000000b` will be selected\r\n- If `Category` property is a navigation property and it points to a row that has a property `CodeValue` that we want to select, the `ECPropertyName` should be set to `Category.CodeValue`\r\n- If `Model` property is a navigation property and it points to a row that has a property `JsonProperties` with a value `{\"formatter\":{\"mastUnit\":{\"label\":\"m\"}}}` and we want to select the master unit label, the `ECPropertyName` should be set to `Model.JsonProperties.formatter.mastUnit.label`. The result will be `m`\r\n\r\n`ECPropertyType` is case sensitive and corresponds to the data type of a `ECProperty` you want to select. Supported Type values are:\r\n\r\n- `Boolean` - describes a logical value which is either true or false,\r\n- `Number` - treated the same as Double,\r\n- `Integer` - describes a whole number,\r\n- `Double` - describes a real number,\r\n- `String` - describes text.\r\n\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nRequires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `itwin-platform`.\r\n\r\nFor more documentation on authorization and how to get access token visit [OAUTH2 Authorization](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/authorization/) page.\r\n\r\n### Authorization\r\n\r\nUser must have `imodels_write` permission(s) assigned at the Project level. iModel specific permissions may also be applied at the iModel level if iModel level permissions are enabled.\r\n\r\nAlternatively the user should be an Organization Administrator for the Organization that owns a given Project or iModel.\r\n\r\nAn Organization Administrator must have at least one of the following roles assigned in User Management: Account Administrator, Co-Administrator, or CONNECT Services Administrator.
