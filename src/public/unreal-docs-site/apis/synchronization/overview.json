As a result, only the master file is synchronized into the iModel. Only applicable for .dgn and .dwg files.\r\nThe default value is false.\r\n\r\nA reference file could have a transform/ level override/ symbology override when attached through a master file. None of these settings will be available if the files are processed individually and could result in data not matching the intended design.\r\n\r\n#### enableSheetsAndDrawings \r\n\r\nControls sheets and drawings synchronization. If enabled all sheet models and relayed drawings will be synchronized to an iModel.\r\nThe default value is false.\r\n\r\n#### enableC3dGraphsIn2dModel\r\n\r\nEnables the separation of 2D elements from 3D elements in the target iModel when using Civil Connector. The 2D elements will be inserted into a graph model, while the 3D elements will be kept in the spatial model. The default value is false.\r\n\r\nStandard AutoCAD 2D entities, such as MTEXT, LINE, POLYLINE, etc., laid on the XY plane in the model space, will be converted as 2D elements and inserted into the graph model. This feature flag does not impact alignments and their labels, which always stay in the spatial model.\r\n\r\nIf the file contains only AutoCAD entities and no Civil3D entities or has Civil3D model entities but no 2D graphics, we suggest leaving this configuration as false.\r\n\r\n#### enableSheetIndex\r\n\r\nA sheet index is a centralized and structured collection of sheets in your WorkSet. Enabling this flag triggers processing of sheet index files from the associated workspace.The default value is false.\r\n\r\nUse case example: Sheet index can be useful in creating a construction document set. So a civil user might be interested in turning on this flag to get the content of the sheets he has configured.\r\n\r\n#### filterBySheetIndex\r\n\r\nA sheet index is a centralized and structured collection of sheets in your WorkSet. Enabling this flag limits (filters) the processing of sheets provided to the connector to the ones specified in the sheet index. The default value is false.\r\n\r\nUse case example: Sheet index can be useful in creating a construction document set. However, there could be large number of sheets present in the input set and the user may be only interested in the ones specified by the sheet index. Enabling this flag allows such filtering.\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nRequires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `itwin-platform`.\r\n\r\nFor more documentation on authorization and how to get access token visit [OAUTH2 Authorization](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/authorization/) page.\r\n\r\n---\r\n","urlTemplate":"/configurations/connections/{connectionid}","templateParameters":[{"name":"connectionid","description":"connection Id","in":"template","type":"string","values":[],"required":true}],"parameters":[{"name":"connectionid","description":"connection Id","in":"template","type":"string","values":[],"required":true}],"method":"POST","request":{"queryParameters":[],"headers":[{"name":"Authorization","description":"OAuth access token with `itwin-platform` scope","in":"header","type":"string","values":[],"required":true},{"name":"Accept","description":"Setting to `application/vnd.bentley.itwin-platform.v1+json` is recommended.","in":"header","type":"string","values":["application/vnd.bentley.itwin-platform.v1+json"],"required":true}],"representations":[{"contentType":"application/json","example":"{\r\n    \"reclassifyDgnElements\": false,\r\n    \"ignoreDgnAttachments\": true,\r\n    \"enableSheetsAndDrawings\": false,\r\n    \"enableC3dGraphsIn2dModel\": false,\r\n    \"filterBySheetIndex\": false,\r\n    \"enableSheetIndex\": false\r\n}","exampleFormat":"json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"connection-configuration-create"}]},"responses":[{"identifier":"66ce0aa46af2f30d47ab8e27","headers":[],"statusCode":{"code":201,"description":"Created"},"representations":[{"contentType":"application/json","example":"{\r\n    \"configuration\": {\r\n        \"scopeId\": \"lggkjEZmT0-NOd2XwpnXYdk9YzROk-1Jr77FJx5z754\",\r\n        \"settings\": {\r\n            \"reclassifyDgnElements\": false,\r\n            \"ignoreDgnAttachments\": true,\r\n            \"enableSheetsAndDrawings\": false,\r\n            \"enableC3dGraphsIn2dModel\": false,\r\n            \"enableSheetIndex\": true,\r\n            \"filterBySheetIndex\": true\r\n        },\r\n        \"resolvedSettings\": {\r\n            \"uploadDgnRealityData\": true,\r\n            \"convertDgnTerrainModels\": false,\r\n            \"enableSheetsAndDrawings\": false,\r\n            \"squashIntermediateRevisions\": false,\r\n            \"skipRvtReprojection\": false,\r\n            \"convertDgnHyperModelingSections\": true,\r\n            \"clampZExtent\": false,\r\n            \"overrideRvtReprojectionDistance\": 0,\r\n            \"enableSheetIndex\": true,\r\n            \"filterBySheetIndex\": true,\r\n            \"reclassifyDgnElements\": false,\r\n            \"ignoreDgnAttachments\": true,\r\n            \"enableC3dGraphsIn2dModel\": false\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}","exampleFormat":"json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"configuration-response"}],"description":"Connection successfully created."},{"identifier":"66ce0aa4fd533b95b7942ac0","headers":[],"statusCode":{"code":401,"description":"Unauthorized"},"representations":[{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"ErrorResponse"}],"description":"This response indicates that request lacks valid authentication credentials.

However, we suggest enhancing the original design files with proper geographic coordinate systems before synchronization instead of using this configuration.\r\n\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nRequires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `itwin-platform`.\r\n\r\nFor more documentation on authorization and how to get access token visit [OAUTH2 Authorization](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/authorization/) page.\r\n\r\n---\r\n","urlTemplate":"/configurations/itwins/{itwinid}","templateParameters":[{"name":"itwinid","description":"iTwin Id","in":"template","type":"string","values":[],"required":true}],"parameters":[{"name":"itwinid","description":"iTwin Id","in":"template","type":"string","values":[],"required":true}],"method":"POST","request":{"queryParameters":[],"headers":[{"name":"Authorization","description":"OAuth access token with `itwin-platform` scope","in":"header","type":"string","values":[],"required":true},{"name":"Accept","description":"Setting to `application/vnd.bentley.itwin-platform.v1+json` is recommended.","in":"header","type":"string","values":["application/vnd.bentley.itwin-platform.v1+json"],"required":true}],"representations":[{"contentType":"application/json","example":"{\r\n    \"uploadDgnRealityData\": true,\r\n    \"convertDgnTerrainModels\": false,\r\n    \"squashIntermediateRevisions\": false,\r\n    \"skipRvtReprojection\": false,\r\n    \"convertDgnHyperModelingSections\": true\r\n}","exampleFormat":"json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"itwin-configuration-create"}]},"responses":[{"identifier":"66ce0aa40bba9b098d2645aa","headers":[],"statusCode":{"code":201,"description":"Created"},"representations":[{"contentType":"application/json","example":"{\r\n    \"configuration\": {\r\n        \"scopeId\": \"7dbd531d-6967-47b2-8945-a722a437ad7a\",\r\n        \"settings\": {\r\n            \"uploadDgnRealityData\": true,\r\n            \"convertDgnTerrainModels\": false,\r\n            \"squashIntermediateRevisions\": false,\r\n            \"skipRvtReprojection\": false,\r\n            \"convertDgnHyperModelingSections\": true\r\n        },\r\n        \"resolvedSettings\": {\r\n            \"uploadDgnRealityData\": true,\r\n            \"convertDgnTerrainModels\": false,\r\n            \"squashIntermediateRevisions\": false,\r\n            \"skipRvtReprojection\": false,\r\n            \"convertDgnHyperModelingSections\": true\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}","exampleFormat":"json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"configuration-response"}],"description":"Configuration successfully created."},{"identifier":"66ce0aa456021080d8ec1f50","headers":[],"statusCode":{"code":401,"description":"Unauthorized"},"representations":[{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"ErrorResponse"}],"description":"This response indicates that request lacks valid authentication credentials.

With this API, you can set up a connection with various source files and, with a job run, synchronize those to an iModel. Requests will be processed in a cloud using associated iTwin connectors.\n\nThe API offers the following:\n\n- iTwin connectors for various design applications and interchange formats. See the complete list in [supported formats section](/apis/synchronization/supported-formats/).\n- File synchronization from [iTwin Storage service](/apis/storage/). Use the [Synchronization Storage](/tutorials/synchronization-storage-tutorial/) tutorial and provided sample [Synchronize File from Storage](https://github.com/iTwin/synchronization-api-sample-app) to help you get started.\n- File synchronization from pre-authenticated urls. Use the [Synchronization Manifest](/tutorials/synchronization-blob-tutorial/) tutorial and provided sample [Synchronize Files from Azure Blob or SharePoint](https://github.com/iTwin/synchronization-manifest-api-sample) to help you get started.\n- Set required synchronization configuration on iTwin, iModel, or Connection scopes. Use the [Configuration](/tutorials/synchronization-configurations-api-tutorial/) tutorial as a guide.<TechPreviewBadge style=\"margin-left:8px; position:relative; bottom:1px\"/> **Technical Preview.**\n  <img src=\"/documentation/synchronization/SynchronizationManifestDiagram.PNG\" alt=\"iTwinSynchronizerSteps\" title=\"iTwin Synchronizer Steps\" style=\"width:70%\"/>\n\nTo create and run initial synchronization:\n  1. Create a manifest connection\n  2. Get pre-authenticated file access URLs\n  3. Run created connection by passing access URLs\n  4. Get the run status\n\nTo update an iModel when engineering data is changed:\n  2. Get pre-authenticated file access URLs\n  3. Run created connection by passing access URLs\n  4. Get the run status\n\n### Connection\n\nThe synchronization process is based on connections that establish links from design files to iModels. For example, there could be multiple connections for an iModel, and those executed on-demand multiple times to continuously synchronize changes. The history of runs is preserved and available for monitoring.\n\n### Source File\n\nA source file entity defines the link between a specific file in the data source and iTwin connector during the synchronization run. Mark the source file as a spatial root if file has geographical coordinate information.\n\n### Run\n\nA run defines a single connection synchronization process. Initialize the run by sending a run start request. This entity has properties like status, duration, and others. There can be only one run per connection at a time.\n\n### Connector\n\nAn iTwin Connector will process a file from an application such as MicroStation and transform the model's content (geometry, properties, and relationships) into an iModel. It will also include creating a schema from the source data. You can synchronize several models using the same Connector or different models using various Connectors to achieve the required iModel.\n\niTwin Connectors detect the differences in the source models between job runs. The synchronization will produce [ChangeSets](/apis/imodels/) – which contain the changes sent to iModelHub. This is the critical difference between a Connector and a one-time converter.\n\nThe first time you run the synchronization, the Changeset will contain the content of the entire model. Subsequent synchronization runs create Changesets for the incremental differences between what previously existed in the iModel and your changes. The iTwin Connector will not process the synchronization if there are no source model changes. In this case, no Changesets are pushed.\n\n### Authorization\n\nThe synchronization process usually takes time and is performed in the background. So there are two ways to call the API:\n\n- If the application is centered around the user and has user interface, user authorization workflow can be used. For that, we need to store the connection owner's refresh token. You can get it by using [Get Authorization Information API](/apis/synchronization/operations/get-authorization-information/). If the token needs to be renewed, this API returns the current status and a redirect URL.\n- If the application does not have a user interface and synchronization will be initiated by a backend service, then service type application should be used and authenticationType: \"Service\" should be set on a connection.\n\n### Media Links\n\nAdditional information can be found here:\n\n- The Synchronization API - [Accreditation course](/accreditation/#synchronization-api)\n- iTwin Developer Conference 2022.
