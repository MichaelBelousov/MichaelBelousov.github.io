As a result, only the master file is synchronized into the iModel. Only applicable for .dgn and .dwg files.\r\nThe default value is false.\r\n\r\nA reference file could have a transform/ level override/ symbology override when attached through a master file. None of these settings will be available if the files are processed individually and could result in data not matching the intended design.\r\n\r\n#### enableSheetsAndDrawings \r\n\r\nControls sheets and drawings synchronization. If enabled all sheet models and relayed drawings will be synchronized to an iModel.\r\nThe default value is false.\r\n\r\n#### enableC3dGraphsIn2dModel\r\n\r\nEnables the separation of 2D elements from 3D elements in the target iModel when using Civil Connector. The 2D elements will be inserted into a graph model, while the 3D elements will be kept in the spatial model. The default value is false.\r\n\r\nStandard AutoCAD 2D entities, such as MTEXT, LINE, POLYLINE, etc., laid on the XY plane in the model space, will be converted as 2D elements and inserted into the graph model. This feature flag does not impact alignments and their labels, which always stay in the spatial model.\r\n\r\nIf the file contains only AutoCAD entities and no Civil3D entities or has Civil3D model entities but no 2D graphics, we suggest leaving this configuration as false.\r\n\r\n#### enableSheetIndex\r\n\r\nA sheet index is a centralized and structured collection of sheets in your WorkSet. Enabling this flag triggers processing of sheet index files from the associated workspace.The default value is false.\r\n\r\nUse case example: Sheet index can be useful in creating a construction document set. So a civil user might be interested in turning on this flag to get the content of the sheets he has configured.\r\n\r\n#### filterBySheetIndex\r\n\r\nA sheet index is a centralized and structured collection of sheets in your WorkSet. Enabling this flag limits (filters) the processing of sheets provided to the connector to the ones specified in the sheet index. The default value is false.\r\n\r\nUse case example: Sheet index can be useful in creating a construction document set. However, there could be large number of sheets present in the input set and the user may be only interested in the ones specified by the sheet index. Enabling this flag allows such filtering.\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nRequires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `itwin-platform`.\r\n\r\nFor more documentation on authorization and how to get access token visit [OAUTH2 Authorization](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/authorization/) page.\r\n\r\n---\r\n","urlTemplate":"/configurations/connections/{connectionid}","templateParameters":[{"name":"connectionid","description":"connection Id","in":"template","type":"string","values":[],"required":true}],"parameters":[{"name":"connectionid","description":"connection Id","in":"template","type":"string","values":[],"required":true}],"method":"POST","request":{"queryParameters":[],"headers":[{"name":"Authorization","description":"OAuth access token with `itwin-platform` scope","in":"header","type":"string","values":[],"required":true},{"name":"Accept","description":"Setting to `application/vnd.bentley.itwin-platform.v1+json` is recommended.","in":"header","type":"string","values":["application/vnd.bentley.itwin-platform.v1+json"],"required":true}],"representations":[{"contentType":"application/json","example":"{\r\n    \"reclassifyDgnElements\": false,\r\n    \"ignoreDgnAttachments\": true,\r\n    \"enableSheetsAndDrawings\": false,\r\n    \"enableC3dGraphsIn2dModel\": false,\r\n    \"filterBySheetIndex\": false,\r\n    \"enableSheetIndex\": false\r\n}","exampleFormat":"json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"connection-configuration-create"}]},"responses":[{"identifier":"66ce0aa5e9be6cd3cfecdd1c","headers":[],"statusCode":{"code":201,"description":"Created"},"representations":[{"contentType":"application/json","example":"{\r\n    \"configuration\": {\r\n        \"scopeId\": \"lggkjEZmT0-NOd2XwpnXYdk9YzROk-1Jr77FJx5z754\",\r\n        \"settings\": {\r\n            \"reclassifyDgnElements\": false,\r\n            \"ignoreDgnAttachments\": true,\r\n            \"enableSheetsAndDrawings\": false,\r\n            \"enableC3dGraphsIn2dModel\": false,\r\n            \"enableSheetIndex\": true,\r\n            \"filterBySheetIndex\": true\r\n        },\r\n        \"resolvedSettings\": {\r\n            \"uploadDgnRealityData\": true,\r\n            \"convertDgnTerrainModels\": false,\r\n            \"enableSheetsAndDrawings\": false,\r\n            \"squashIntermediateRevisions\": false,\r\n            \"skipRvtReprojection\": false,\r\n            \"convertDgnHyperModelingSections\": true,\r\n            \"clampZExtent\": false,\r\n            \"overrideRvtReprojectionDistance\": 0,\r\n            \"enableSheetIndex\": true,\r\n            \"filterBySheetIndex\": true,\r\n            \"reclassifyDgnElements\": false,\r\n            \"ignoreDgnAttachments\": true,\r\n            \"enableC3dGraphsIn2dModel\": false\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}","exampleFormat":"json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"configuration-response"}],"description":"Connection successfully created."},{"identifier":"66ce0aa541c3c4ea0177fcf0","headers":[],"statusCode":{"code":401,"description":"Unauthorized"},"representations":[{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"ErrorResponse"}],"description":"This response indicates that request lacks valid authentication credentials.

However, we suggest enhancing the original design files with proper geographic coordinate systems before synchronization instead of using this configuration.\r\n\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nRequires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `itwin-platform`.\r\n\r\nFor more documentation on authorization and how to get access token visit [OAUTH2 Authorization](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/authorization/) page.\r\n\r\n---\r\n","urlTemplate":"/configurations/itwins/{itwinid}","templateParameters":[{"name":"itwinid","description":"iTwin Id","in":"template","type":"string","values":[],"required":true}],"parameters":[{"name":"itwinid","description":"iTwin Id","in":"template","type":"string","values":[],"required":true}],"method":"POST","request":{"queryParameters":[],"headers":[{"name":"Authorization","description":"OAuth access token with `itwin-platform` scope","in":"header","type":"string","values":[],"required":true},{"name":"Accept","description":"Setting to `application/vnd.bentley.itwin-platform.v1+json` is recommended.","in":"header","type":"string","values":["application/vnd.bentley.itwin-platform.v1+json"],"required":true}],"representations":[{"contentType":"application/json","example":"{\r\n    \"uploadDgnRealityData\": true,\r\n    \"convertDgnTerrainModels\": false,\r\n    \"squashIntermediateRevisions\": false,\r\n    \"skipRvtReprojection\": false,\r\n    \"convertDgnHyperModelingSections\": true\r\n}","exampleFormat":"json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"itwin-configuration-create"}]},"responses":[{"identifier":"66ce0aa5c3de70442abd089f","headers":[],"statusCode":{"code":201,"description":"Created"},"representations":[{"contentType":"application/json","example":"{\r\n    \"configuration\": {\r\n        \"scopeId\": \"7dbd531d-6967-47b2-8945-a722a437ad7a\",\r\n        \"settings\": {\r\n            \"uploadDgnRealityData\": true,\r\n            \"convertDgnTerrainModels\": false,\r\n            \"squashIntermediateRevisions\": false,\r\n            \"skipRvtReprojection\": false,\r\n            \"convertDgnHyperModelingSections\": true\r\n        },\r\n        \"resolvedSettings\": {\r\n            \"uploadDgnRealityData\": true,\r\n            \"convertDgnTerrainModels\": false,\r\n            \"squashIntermediateRevisions\": false,\r\n            \"skipRvtReprojection\": false,\r\n            \"convertDgnHyperModelingSections\": true\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}","exampleFormat":"json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"configuration-response"}],"description":"Configuration successfully created."},{"identifier":"66ce0aa5f78cde2ade18d8f7","headers":[],"statusCode":{"code":401,"description":"Unauthorized"},"representations":[{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"1f77e5dfe1c6960c0cc24239","typeName":"ErrorResponse"}],"description":"This response indicates that request lacks valid authentication credentials.
