It can detect objects or features in 2D and 3D for defect analysis, image anonymization, image indexing, asset management, mobile mapping, aerial surveying, and more.\n\n*Reality Analysis* is articulated around *Reality Data* and *Jobs*. Reality Data are the data be to analyzed (photos, maps, meshes or point clouds). To describe on which data the analysis should be run and potentially some extra metadata (e.g. photo positions), we introduce a new type of Reality Data named *ContextScenes*. The analysis usually requires one or more Machine Learning models (e.g. a deep learning neural network). We call them *ContextDetectors*. \nGiven ContextScenes and ContextDetectors, a Reality Analysis job produces different kinds of annotations (e.g. detected objects), which we store again in a ContextScene.\n\nAll the above mentioned reality data are stored via the Reality Management Service. The rest of the presentation assumes that you are familiar with the [Reality Management API](/apis/reality-management).\n\nThe [tutorials](/apis/realitydataanalysis/tutorials/) and [samples](/apis/realitydataanalysis/samples/)  are good places to start using Reality Analysis, as well as the [API Reference](/apis/realitydataanalysis/operations/). Before we recommend reading:\n- The [Context Scene](/apis/realitydataanalysis/rda-cs/) description.\n- What a [Context Detector](/apis/realitydataanalysis/rda-cd/) is.\n- An overview of the different Reality Analysis [job types](/apis/realitydataanalysis/rda-jobtypes/).\n- [Python and TypeScript SDKs and samples](https://github.com/iTwin/reality-capture/) to use iTwin Capture services.\n\n","tutorialsMetadata":[{"title":"Get started with the Reality Analysis API","tile":{"name":"Get started with the Reality Analysis API","description":"This tutorial is an introduction to Reality Analysis API, explaining the basic workflows.","thumbnail":"/unreal-docs-site/static/images/rda/quick-start-thumb.jpg","href":"/tutorials/realitydataanalysis-api-quick-start/","durationInMinutes":60,"relatedApiIds":["realitydataanalysis"]}}],"preloadedApis":[],"changelog":[],"preloadedSamples":[]},"__N_SSG":true}
