Bentley's iTwin platform integration with One Click LCA allows you to take Quantity Takeoff Reports created using the iTwin Reporting platform and export them to One Click LCA for convenient Life Cycle Analysis for both infrastructure projects and buildings. The iTwin platform enables the incorporation of engineering data created by various design tools. A summary of the design data is exported through this integration, allowing you to gain insights into the environmental impacts of your infrastructure project.\r\n\r\nFor guidance on creating a report, see [iTwin Reporting Platform documentation](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/insights).\r\n\r\n> An account with One Click LCA is required to use this integration.
