EC3 is built by Building Transparency with a core mission to provide open access data and the tools necessary to enable broad and swift action across the building industry addressing embodied carbon's role in climate change. Bentley's iTwin platform integration with EC3 allows you to take Quantity Takeoff Reports created using the iTwin Reporting platform and export them to EC3 for convenient Life Cycle Analysis for both infrastructure projects and buildings. The iTwin platform enables the incorporation of engineering data created by various design tools. A summary of the design data is exported through this integration, allowing you to gain insights into the environmental impacts of your infrastructure project.\r\n\r\nFor guidance on creating a report, see [iTwin Reporting Platform documentation](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/insights).\r\n\r\nFor guidance on how to use EC3, terminology and data requirements, see [EC3 User Guide](https://www.buildingtransparency.org/ec3-resources/ec3-user-guide/).\r\n\r\n> An account with EC3 is required to use this integration.
