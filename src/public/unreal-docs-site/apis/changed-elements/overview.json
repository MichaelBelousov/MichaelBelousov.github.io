This interface contains different arrays of the same size. Each element is specified by a single index in all arrays. Some of the relevant arrays to understand what changes occurred to an element are listed below:\r\n\r\n**opcodes**: Contains the operation codes that tells us if the element was inserted, updated, or deleted in the change. See [DbOpcode](https://www.itwinjs.org/reference/core-bentley/besqlite/dbopcode/) for more information. The appropriate values are listed below:\r\n\r\n| Opcode | Description |\r\n|:------:|-----------|\r\n| 9 | Element was deleted |\r\n| 23 | Element was modified |\r\n| 18 | Element was inserted |\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n**type**: Contains the type of change that occurred to the element. This number is a bit-flag and can be used to know whether the element had property changes, geometric changes, placement changes, indirect changes, and hidden property changes. See [TypeOfChange](https://www.itwinjs.org/reference/core-common/entities/typeofchange/) for more information. Below is a table with the values and their meaning:\r\n\r\n| Type | Value | Description |\r\n|------|:-----:|-------------|\r\n| Property | 1 | A property in the element changed |\r\n| Geometry | 2 | The geometry of the element changed |\r\n| Placement | 4 | The placement of the element changed.
