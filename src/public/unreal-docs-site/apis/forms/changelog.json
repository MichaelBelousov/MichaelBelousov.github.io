(Cascading lists are a set of &lt;select&gt; elements where only the first one is initially enabled until an option in it is selected, and then, depending on which option was selected, the available options in the next list can vary.)

Since the result has two properties (\"AFC\" and \"NFC\") as direct children of the \"optionsTree\" property, the first list in the cascading list chain would have two options--\"AFC\" and \"NFC\".  Whichever option is chosen, its child properties become available for selection in the second list, and so forth.  For example, if \"AFC\" and \"North\" were chosen for the first two lists respectively, the third list would show the available options \"Bengals\", \"Browns\", \"Ravens\", and \"Steelers\".  These four properties just have empty objects as their values because this particular list group only has three layers; these options are the final options in the chain and have no descendants.\r\n\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nRequires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `itwin-platform`.\r\n\r\nFor more documentation on authorization and how to get access token visit [OAUTH2 Authorization](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/authorization/) page.\r\n\r\n---","urlTemplate":"/formDefinitions/{id}/listGroups/{listGroupId}","templateParameters":[{"name":"id","description":"The ID of the form definition the list group is used in.","in":"template","type":"string","values":[],"required":true},{"name":"listGroupId","description":"The list group's ID.","in":"template","type":"string","values":[],"required":true}],"parameters":[{"name":"id","description":"The ID of the form definition the list group is used in.","in":"template","type":"string","values":[],"required":true},{"name":"listGroupId","description":"The list group's ID.","in":"template","type":"string","values":[],"required":true}],"method":"GET","request":{"queryParameters":[],"headers":[{"name":"Authorization","description":"OAuth access token with `itwin-platform` scope","in":"header","values":[],"required":true},{"name":"Accept","description":"Setting to `application/vnd.bentley.itwin-platform.v1+json` is recommended.","in":"header","values":[],"required":true}],"representations":[]},"responses":[{"identifier":"66ce0a9b84b80c8a94a9b8ed","headers":[],"statusCode":{"code":200,"description":"OK"},"representations":[{"contentType":"application/json","example":"{\r\n    \"listGroup\": {\r\n        \"id\": \"1d49859f-0757-423a-b850-9b6ae0a088c6\",\r\n        \"lists\": [\r\n            \"Conference\",\r\n            \"Division\",\r\n            \"Team\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"optionsTree\": {\r\n            \"AFC\": {\r\n                \"North\": {\r\n                    \"Steelers\": {},\r\n                    \"Browns\": {},\r\n                    \"Bengals\": {},\r\n                    \"Ravens\": {}\r\n                },\r\n                \"East\": {\r\n                    \"Patriots\": {},\r\n                    \"Bills\": {},\r\n                    \"Dolphins\": {},\r\n                    \"Jets\": {}\r\n                },\r\n                \"South\": {\r\n                    \"Titans\": {},\r\n                    \"Jaguars\": {},\r\n                    \"Texans\": {},\r\n                    \"Colts\": {}\r\n                },\r\n                \"West\": {\r\n                    \"Chiefs\": {},\r\n                    \"Broncos\": {},\r\n                    \"Raiders\": {},\r\n                    \"Chargers\": {}\r\n                }\r\n            },\r\n            \"NFC\": {\r\n                \"North\": {\r\n                    \"Vikings\": {},\r\n                    \"Packers\": {},\r\n                    \"Bears\": {},\r\n                    \"Lions\": {}\r\n                },\r\n                \"East\": {\r\n                    \"Eagles\": {},\r\n                    \"Giants\": {},\r\n                    \"Cowboys\": {},\r\n                    \"Washington\": {}\r\n                },\r\n                \"South\": {\r\n                    \"Saints\": {},\r\n                    \"Buccaneers\": {},\r\n                    \"Panthers\": {},\r\n                    \"Falcons\": {}\r\n                },\r\n                \"West\": {\r\n                    \"49ers\": {},\r\n                    \"Seahawks\": {},\r\n                    \"Rams\": {},\r\n                    \"Cardinals\": {}\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}","exampleFormat":"json","schemaId":"forms-components","typeName":"list-group-response"}],"description":"OK"},{"identifier":"66ce0a9bd16d32d8a8368ecd","headers":[],"statusCode":{"code":401,"description":"Unauthorized"},"representations":[{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"forms-components","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"forms-components","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"forms-components","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"forms-components","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"forms-components","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"forms-components","typeName":"ErrorResponse"}],"description":"This response indicates that request lacks valid authentication credentials.
