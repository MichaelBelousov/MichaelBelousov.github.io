That new iModel is considered to be an iModel clone. Id of the source iModel is specified in the request url while the id of the target iTwin which will contain the new iModel is specified in the request body.\r\n\r\n### Relationship between the source iModel and the iModel clone\r\n\r\niModel clone is a valid standalone iModel. After the iModel cloning process is completed, no new changes are synchronized to the iModel clone from the source iModel. iModel clone is not deleted if the source iModel is deleted.\r\n\r\n### iModel clone content and metadata\r\n\r\nThe target iModel name and description can be specified when cloning an iModel, by default name and description are taken from the source iModel. iModel extent is always taken from the source iModel.\r\n\r\n[iModel Baseline](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/imodels-v2/operations/get-imodel-baseline-file-details/) is always copied from the source iModel to the target iModel. User can specify until which point [Changesets](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/imodels-v2/operations/get-imodel-changesets/) should be copied to the target iModel, by default all source iModel Changesets are copied. The rest of source iModel entities are not copied.\r\n\r\n### Operation state\r\n\r\nClone iModel is an asynchronous operation. To check the status of the operation please follow the link present in `Create-iModel-Operation` response header. The link points to [Get Create iModel Operation details](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/imodels-v2/operations/get-create-imodel-operation-details/) endpoint of the target iModel. When the target iModel's Create Operation `state` property is set to `successful` it means the cloning process is complete and iModel is ready to be used.\r\n\r\n`Location` header value is a link to [Get iModel details](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/imodels-v2/operations/get-imodel-details/) endpoint of the target iModel which provides metadata about the the target iModel as well as when it is ready to be used. When target iModel's `state` property is set to `initialized` the iModel is ready to be used.\r\n\r\nPlease note that iModel may be marked as `initialized` before the iModel Create Operation is marked as `successful`. Such behavior allows target iModel to be utilized faster. The cloning background process first of all copies the critical iModel data and marks the iModel as `initialized`, and then copies additional data used to improve performance for iModel viewing and authoring workflows.\r\n\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nRequires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `itwin-platform`.\r\n\r\nFor more documentation on authorization and how to get access token visit [OAUTH2 Authorization](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/authorization/) page.\r\n\r\n### Authorization\r\n\r\nUser must have the following permissions:\r\n- `imodels_manage` permission at the source iModel iTwin level. \r\n- `imodels_manage` permission at the target iTwin level. \r\n\r\nIf source iModel has iModel level permissions configured, then user must have at least `imodels_webview` permission assigned at iModel level.\r\n\r\nAlternatively the user should be an Organization Administrator both for the Organization that owns source iModel iTwin and the Organization that owns target iTwin.\r\n\r\nFor more information please refer to [Account Administrator](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/access-control-v2/overview/#accountadministrator) documentation section on Access Control API documentation page.\r\n\r\n### Rate limits\r\n\r\nThis operation has a lower rate limit than the rest of iModels API operations.

There are three steps in creating an iModel from a Baseline File:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new iModel and provide `baselineFile` property. **It is important to provide correct file size or the iModel creation will fail in the later steps.**\r\n\r\n2. Upload Baseline File to blob storage using `upload` property link from the response of iModel creation.\r\n```\r\nRequest syntax:\r\n    PUT upload HTTP/1.1\r\nRequest headers:\r\n    x-ms-blob-type: BlockBlob\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Complete the iModel creation by confirming that Baseline File was uploaded successfully. See [Complete iModel Baseline Upload](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/imodels-v2/operations/complete-imodel-baseline-file-upload/) operation for the documentation.\r\n\r\n### iModel initialization\r\n\r\nWhen creating an empty iModel it will be initialized immediately. When creating an iModel using `template` or `baselineFile` properties initialization will be scheduled and it's state is reflected in the `state` property. For a more detailed information about initialization state see [Get iModel Baseline File](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/imodels-v2/operations/get-imodel-baseline-file-details/) operation.\r\n\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nRequires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `itwin-platform`.\r\n\r\nFor more documentation on authorization and how to get access token visit [OAUTH2 Authorization](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/authorization/) page.\r\n\r\n### Authorization\r\n\r\nUser must have the `imodels_manage` permission assigned at the iTwin level or be an Organization Administrator for the Organization that owns a given iTwin.\r\n\r\nFor more information please refer to [Account Administrator](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/access-control-v2/overview/#accountadministrator) documentation section on Access Control API documentation page.\r\n\r\n### Rate limits\r\n\r\nThis operation has a lower rate limit than the rest of iModels API operations.

An iModel fork is a new iModel which is a full or partial clone of the main (source) iModel, but the difference between an iModel fork and an iModel clone is that forks can be edited and then merged back to the main iModel using [Merge iModel transformation](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/transformations/operations/mergeimodel/).\r\n\r\n### Relationship between main and fork iModels\r\n\r\nAn iModel fork is a valid standalone iModel. An iModel fork is not deleted if the main iModel is deleted.\r\n\r\nWhen the iModel forking process is completed, no new changes are synchronized to the iModel fork from the main iModel.\r\n\r\n[iModel Create Operation Details](https://dev-developer.bentley.com/apis/imodels-v2/operations/get-create-imodel-operation-details/) operation can be used to determine if the current iModel is a fork.\r\n\r\n### iModel fork content and metadata\r\n\r\nThe iModel fork name and description can be specified when forking an iModel, by default name and description are taken from the main iModel. iModel extent is always taken from the main iModel.\r\n\r\n[iModel Baseline](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/imodels-v2/operations/get-imodel-baseline-file-details/) is always copied from the main iModel to the iModel fork. User can specify until which point [Changesets](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/imodels-v2/operations/get-imodel-changesets/) should be copied to the iModel fork, by default all main iModel Changesets are copied. The rest of main iModel entities are not copied.\r\n\r\n### Operation state\r\n\r\nForking an iModel is an asynchronous operation. To check the status of the operation please follow the link present in `Create-iModel-Operation` response header. The link points to [Get Create iModel Operation details](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/imodels-v2/operations/get-create-imodel-operation-details/) endpoint of the iModel fork. When the iModel fork's Create Operation `state` property is set to `successful` it means the forking process is complete and iModel is ready to be used.\r\n\r\n#### `mainIModelIsMissingFederationGuids` state\r\n\r\nIf `state` returned by [Get Create iModel Operation details](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/imodels-v2/operations/get-create-imodel-operation-details/) is equal to `mainIModelIsMissingFederationGuids`, it means that iModel fork creation failed because some elements in the main iModel do not have [FederationGuid](https://www.itwinjs.org/bis/guide/fundamentals/federationguids/) property set. In order to proceed users must populate missing FederationGuid values in main iModel using [Populate Federation Guids transformation](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/transformations/operations/populatefederationguids/) and retry the iModel fork creation request.\r\n\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nRequires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `itwin-platform`.\r\n\r\nFor more documentation on authorization and how to get access token visit [OAUTH2 Authorization](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/authorization/) page.\r\n\r\n### Authorization\r\n\r\nUser must have the following permissions:\r\n- `imodels_manage` permission at the main iModel iTwin level.\r\n- `imodels_manage` permission at the iTwin, in which the iModel fork will be created, level.\r\n\r\nIf main iModel has iModel level permissions configured, then user must have at least `imodels_webview` permission assigned.\r\n\r\nAlternatively the user should be an Organization Administrator both for the Organization that owns main iModel iTwin and the Organization that owns the iModel fork iTwin.\r\n\r\nFor more information please refer to [Account Administrator](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/access-control-v2/overview/#accountadministrator) documentation section on Access Control API documentation page.\r\n\r\n**Important**: Fork iModel operation is in closed preview mode currently and only selected applications can utilize it.\r\n\r\n### Rate limits\r\n\r\nThis operation has a lower rate limit than the rest of iModels API operations. If an application exceeds the rate limit it will receive an HTTP error code 429 \"Too Many Requests\".
