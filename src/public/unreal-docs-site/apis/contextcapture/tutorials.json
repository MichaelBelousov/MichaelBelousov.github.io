New Named Version Created\r\n2. Changeset Group Completed\r\n\r\nWhen any of those events trigger, the API will process the new changes and store a summary of all the elements that have changed.\r\n\r\nAfter tracking is enabled and the iModel is processed, the comparison endpoint may be used to query for a summary of changed elements between any two given `ChangeSets`.","displayName":"Changed Elements","name":"changed-elements","path":"changedelements","tags":["General Availability","Project Delivery"]},{"apiGroupId":"project-delivery","id":"/apis/forms","description":"Forms Service\r\n\r\nView, create, and edit details of forms that have been filled out for an iTwin/project, as well as their comments, attached files, and change history.

It determines the \"type\" of form that is filled out, and in applications that support custom form layouts, it determines how the controls are placed in the user interface.\r\n\r\nForm definitions should be added, imported, and customized by project administrators through the Bentley Form Manager web application; they cannot be modified using this API.
