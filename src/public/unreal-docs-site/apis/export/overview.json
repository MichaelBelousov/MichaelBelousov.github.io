The export process usually takes time and is performed in the background. For that, we need to store the user's refresh token. The refresh token needs to be stored before calling the 'Create ExportConnection Run' end-point. You can get authorization information by using [Get Authorization Information API](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/export/operations/get-authorizationinformation/). This API will return the current status and a redirect URL if the token has to be renewed.\r\n\r\n2. When a run is successfully created, the operation returns HTTP status code 202/accepted - the request is accepted for processing and will execute in background. The response will include a location header pointing to the created run. If an existing active run already exists for the iModel, a new run is not initiated, instead 303/see other is returned along with location header pointing to that existing active run. \r\nIn the rare event that multiple create run requests are being made simultaneously, only the first request is processed and 409/conflict is returned for others.\r\n\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nRequires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `itwin-platform`.\r\n\r\nFor more documentation on authorization and how to get access token visit [OAUTH2 Authorization](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/authorization/) page.\r\n\r\n---","urlTemplate":"/connections/{connectionId}/runs","templateParameters":[{"name":"connectionId","description":"Connection Id","in":"template","type":"string","values":[],"required":true}],"parameters":[{"name":"connectionId","description":"Connection Id","in":"template","type":"string","values":[],"required":true}],"method":"POST","request":{"queryParameters":[],"headers":[{"name":"Authorization","description":"OAuth access token with `itwin-platform` scope","in":"header","type":"string","values":[],"required":true},{"name":"Accept","description":"Setting to `application/vnd.bentley.itwin-platform.v1+json` is recommended.","in":"header","type":"string","values":["application/vnd.bentley.itwin-platform.v1+json"],"required":true}],"representations":[{"contentType":"application/json","example":"{\r\n    \"exportType\": \"IFC\",\r\n    \"ifcVersion\": \"IFC4.3\",\r\n    \"inputOptions\": {\r\n        \"mappingFileId\": \"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\r\n        \"changesetId\": \"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\r\n        \"savedViewId\": \"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"outputOptions\": {\r\n        \"location\": \"USER_BLOB_STORAGE\",\r\n        \"outputSasUrl\": \"https://abc.com\",\r\n        \"logsSasUrl\": \"https://abc.com\",\r\n        \"folderId\": \"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\r\n        \"replaceOlderFile\": true,\r\n        \"saveLogs\": true\r\n    }\r\n}","exampleFormat":"json","schemaId":"v1-schema","typeName":"export-run-create"}]},"responses":[{"identifier":"66ce0a9f83fb1774a5e80f37","headers":[{"name":"Location","description":"The resource location","in":"header","type":"string","values":[],"required":true}],"statusCode":{"code":202,"description":"Accepted"},"representations":[],"description":"Accepted"},{"identifier":"66ce0a9f5ea02279bb7291e0","headers":[{"name":"Location","description":"The resource location","in":"header","type":"string","values":[],"required":true}],"statusCode":{"code":303,"description":"See Other"},"representations":[],"description":"This response indicates that an active run is in progress and link is provided in location header."},{"identifier":"66ce0a9f0fdcc258d1249307","headers":[],"statusCode":{"code":401,"description":"Unauthorized"},"representations":[{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"v1-schema","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"v1-schema","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"v1-schema","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"v1-schema","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"v1-schema","typeName":"ErrorResponse"},{"contentType":"application/json","schemaId":"v1-schema","typeName":"ErrorResponse"}],"description":"This response indicates that request lacks valid authentication credentials.

With this API, you can start exporting from an iModel and with a job run, the output file will be stored against the projectId provided. To get the file generated use Storage API.\r\n\r\nThe API supports following export types:\r\n\r\n- IFC (IFC versions supported - 'IFC4.3', 'IFC2x3', 'IFC2x3 CV 2.0', 'IFC4 RV 1.2').\r\n- LandXML.\r\n\r\nNote: 'LandXML' export type supports only Horizontal Alignments for now. Support for other elements will be added in future.\r\n\r\nTo create and run an export:\r\n  1. Create an export connection.\r\n  2. Run the created connection by passing the necessary information.\r\n  3. Get the run status.\r\n\r\n### Connection\r\n\r\nThe export process is based on connections that establish links to iModels. For example, there could be multiple connections for an iModel, and those executed on-demand multiple times to continuously export changes. The history of runs is preserved and available for monitoring.\r\n\r\n### Run\r\n\r\nA run defines a single connection export process. Initialize the run by sending a run start request. This entity has properties like status, duration, and others. There can be only one run per connection at a time.\r\n\r\n### Authorization\r\n\r\nThe export process usually takes time and is performed in the background. For that, we need to store the user's refresh token. The refresh token needs to be stored before calling the 'Create ExportConnection Run' end-point. You can get authorization information by using [Get Authorization Information API](/apis/export/operations/get-authorization-information/). This API will return the current status and a redirect URL if the token has to be renewed.","tutorialsMetadata":[{"title":"Export data from an iModel","tile":{"name":"Export data from an iModel","description":"This tutorial guides you through exporting data from an iModel to other formats, such as IFC or LandXM using the Export API.","href":"/tutorials/export-data-from-imodel/","durationInMinutes":30,"relatedApiIds":["export","imodels"]}}],"preloadedApis":[],"changelog":[],"preloadedSamples":[]},"__N_SSG":true}
