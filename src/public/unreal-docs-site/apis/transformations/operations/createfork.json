Dynamic schema modifications include the removal of unused ECClasses and merging multiple ECClasses into a single ECClass.\r\n\r\nConfiguration specific properties explained:\r\n\r\n```\r\nschemaOptimizationOptions - options that will modify ECSchemas.\r\n    - removeUnusedClasses - if `true` ECClasses that have 0 elements will be removed from all **dynamic** ECSchemas.\r\n    - classMergingGroups - array of ECClass merging group objects.\r\n        - sourceECClasses - array of ECClass objects. Classes in this array will be merged into a single target ECClass. All class elements will also be remapped into the target ECClass.\r\n            - ecClassName - ECClass name.\r\n            - ecSchemaName - ECSchema name.\r\n        - targetECClass - target ECClass. all sourceECClasses will be merged into this ECClass.\r\n            - ecClassName - ECClass name.\r\n            - ecSchemaName - ECSchema name.\r\ndataRemappingOptions - options for data remapping.\r\n    - additionalECSchemas - array of Bentley defined ECSchemas that will be imported into the target iModel\r\n        - ecSchemaName - ECSchema name.\r\n        - ecSchemaVersion - ECSchema version.\r\n    - elementGroups - array of element group objects. Each object in the array defines a collection of elements to be mapped into a single target ECClass.\r\n        - targetECClass - a target class for the elements selected by the `elementPropertyQuery` to be remapped into.\r\n            - ecClassName - ECClass name.\r\n            - ecSchemaName - ECSchema name.\r\n        - elementPropertyQuery - ECSql query that selects element ECInstanceIds and any additional properties.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Target ECClass\r\n\r\nIf `targetECClass` does not exist in the source iModel its schema must be imported using the `additionalECSchemas` property.\r\n\r\n### Element Property query\r\n\r\nThe `elementPropertyQuery` must be a valid ECSql statement. The only requirement for the query is that it must select ECInstanceId column. Elements with these ids will be remapped into the `targetECClass`. Any additional column the query returns is treated as an additional property. Given that the additional property's column name and an ECProperty in the `targetECClass` name match, its value will be carried through and will be exported as that ECProperty's value in the target iModel. Column names for ECProperties are case insensitive.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n`ArchitecturalPhysical.Door` ECClass has 3 ECProperties defined - `OverallHeight`, `OverallWidth` and `Description`. To remap all `Generic.PhysicalObject` elements that have \"door\" in their UserLabel to an `ArchitecturalPhysical.Door` ECClass, a valid `elementPropertyQuery` would be:\r\n- `SELECT ECInstanceId, 'This element was remapped from PhysicalObject' as Description, 15 as OverallHeight FROM Generic.PhysicalObject WHERE UserLabel LIKE '%door%'`\r\n\r\nRemapped elements in the target iModel would have the following properties:\r\n- Description: 'This element was remapped from PhysicalObject'\r\n- OverallHeight: 15\r\n- OverallWidth: NULL\r\n- ...\r\n\r\nOriginal properties will be carried through from the original element and any properties that do not exist in the target class will be lost.\r\n\r\nTo change already existing element property, select an already existing column. The following query will change all `BisCore.PhysicalObject` class element's user labels to 'Updated user label':\r\n`SELECT ECInstanceId, 'Updated user label' as UserLabel FROM Generic.PhysicalObject`\r\n\r\nIn addition to exported data, the transformer will also push some additional metadata. This metadata contains:\r\n1. `BisCore:RepositoryLink` and `BisCore:ExternalSource` elements that mark the source where the data was imported from.\r\n1. A \"Scope\" `BisCore:ExternalSourceAspect` that contains Synchronization changeset metadata that is needed by the transformation service to process any later changes correctly.\r\n1. Element provenance information (`BisCore:ExternalSourceAspects`) for elements that do not have federation guids.\r\n\r\n**Note**: Creating a configuration does not run the transformation. To run the transformation, please see [transformations](/apis/transformations/operations/create-transformation/) reference.\r\n\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nRequires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `itwin-platform`.\r\n\r\nFor more documentation on authorization and how to get access token visit [OAUTH2 Authorization](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/authorization/) page.\r\n\r\n### Authorization\r\n\r\nYou must have `imodels_write` assigned at the target project level and `imodels_read` assigned at the source project level within related [configuration](/apis/transformations/operations/get-configuration/).

IModels are imported into the target in the same order that they were provided in (`configuration.sourceIModel`, `configuration.transformParameters.iModels[0]`, `configuration.transformParameters.iModels[1]`, etc.).\r\n\r\nFor every source iModel a `BisCore:Subject` is created in the target iModel. Each source iModel's contents are exported under their corresponding subject in the target. Subjects are named after their source iModels. Any possible naming conflicts are resolved by appending a number to the subject's name if needed (ex. `Duplicate name 2`).\r\n\r\nAlso, a new definition partition is created under new subject to persist all ViewDefinitions from source iModels, even if they have conflicting codes. This means that all ViewAttachment, ViewDefinition, ModelSelector, DisplayStyle and CategorySelector elements that are scoped under the dictionary model (id '0x10'), will be remapped under this newly created definition partition.\r\n\r\nElement conflicts can occur when merging iModels (e.g. 2 subCategories with the same Element Code have different appearance props).\r\nIn this case, every iModel in the import chain will keep overwriting the conflicting element effectively preserving the last value that was found. This means that the last iModel in the `transformParameters.iModels` list will take precedence.\r\nOnly elements whose scoping hierarchy ultimately reaches elements with ids `0x10` (dictionaryId) and `0xe` will be able to conflict with each other (most common cases are `DefinitionElement`s). Any other elements that are ultimately scoped by the root subject will be imported under a new subject as mentioned above and cannot conflict (because their scope becomes unique).\r\n\r\nThe first Geo location that is found will be applied onto the target iModel.\r\nFor example, if merging three iModels in this order:\r\n\r\n1. `iModel A` (not geo located)\r\n2. `iModel B` (geo location is `BB`)\r\n3. `iModel C` (geo location is `CC`)\r\n\r\nTarget iModel will have geo location set to `BB`.\r\n\r\nConfiguration specific properties explained:\r\n```\r\niModels - list of iModels to combine the source iModel with.\r\n    - iModelId - id of iModel\r\n    - projectId - id of project that iModel belongs to\r\n```\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n**Limitations**: This API does not support combining iModels that have conflicting dynamic ECSchemas.\r\nConflicting ECSchemas are two ECSchemas that have the same name, but have at least one difference such as:\r\n different aliases or any difference between EC object items ([EC schema contents](https://www.itwinjs.org/bis/ec/)).\r\n For example, \"CustomSchema\" in iModel \"A\" has an ECClass \"MyClass\", while \"CustomSchema\" in iModel \"B\" doesn't have\r\n an ECClass \"MyClass\".\r\n\r\nIn case of ECSchema conflict, transformation will fail with an error message. Those error messages\r\nmight vary depending on the conflict that was encountered. Transformation status and \r\nit's error message can be retrieved by sending \r\n[GET transformation](/apis/transformations/operations/get-transformation/) request.\r\n\r\nIn addition to exported data, the transformer will also push some additional metadata. This metadata contains:\r\n1. `BisCore:RepositoryLink` and `BisCore:ExternalSource` elements that mark the source where the data was imported from.\r\n1. A \"Scope\" `BisCore:ExternalSourceAspect` that contains Synchronization changeset metadata that is needed by the transformation service to process any later changes correctly.\r\n1.

The target iModel must be a clone of the source iModel. You can clone the existing iModel using iModels API's endpoints:\r\n- [Create iModel](/apis/imodels-v2/operations/create-imodel/). \r\n- [Clone iModel](/apis/imodels-v2/operations/clone-imodel/). \r\n\r\nConsecutive CreateFork transformations may be used to pull changes from the main iModel into the fork iModel.\r\n\r\nTo synchronize changes in the \"reverse\" (fork -> main) direction see [MergeFork configuration](/apis/transformations/operations/mergefork/).\r\n\r\nIn addition to exported data, the transformer will also push some additional metadata. This metadata contains:\r\n1. `BisCore:RepositoryLink` and `BisCore:ExternalSource` elements that mark the source where the data was imported from.\r\n1. A \"Scope\" `BisCore:ExternalSourceAspect` that contains Synchronization changeset metadata that is needed by the transformation service to process any later changes correctly.\r\n1. Element provenance information (`BisCore:ExternalSourceAspects`) for elements that do not have federation guids.\r\n\r\n**Limitations**: Since an iModel can contain multiple forks there is a possibility that any given fork and the main iModel end up with conflicting schemas, e.g., the same ECProperty in one schema is of type \"number\" and in another schema it is of type \"string\". Schema conflicts are not handled by the transformations service and in these cases the transformation will fail.\r\n\r\n**Note**: Creating a configuration does not run the transformation.

A View is an element of the ViewDefinition class. For more information, see [Using Views in iTwin.js](https://www.itwinjs.org/learning/frontend/views/).\r\n\r\nThis transformation is usually leveraged to filter out unnecessary data and align an iModel to the view within a browser window.\r\n\r\n**Limitations**: Saved views are capable of displaying elements while hiding their parent elements. \r\nThis cannot be achieved by filtering logic because child elements cannot exist without their parent elements within an iModel. \r\nTo workaround this misalignment between display and filtering logic, the transformations service does not filter out:\r\n\r\n- elements that are ancestors of visible child elements\r\n- elements that are scoping ancestors of visible elements\r\n\r\nSuch elements will remain in iModel with cleared properties, meaning that their geometries and other non mandatory properties will be deleted.\r\n\r\nConfiguration specific properties explained:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodels - ids of enabled/visible models contained within a view definition.\r\nhiddenModels - ids of disabled/hidden models contained within a view definition.\r\ncategories - ids of visible enabled/categories contained within a view definition.\r\nhiddenCategories - ids of disabled/hidden categories contained within a view definition.\r\nneverDrawn - element ids which should be left out of the target iModel.\r\nalwaysDrawn - element ids which should be included in to the target iModel.\r\nisAlwaysDrawnExclusive - boolean flag that determines whether all elements, except those defined in \"alwaysDrawn\", should be filtered out. The default value is false if not specified.\r\nsubCategoryOvr\r\n    - subCategory - id of sub category \r\n    - invisible - geometry belonging to an invisible subCategory will be left out of target iModel\r\nclip - data needed to create clipping. This cannot be an empty object.\r\n    - shapes - array of shape clippings\r\n        - points - array of number arrays describing the polygon. Each low level array contains numbers corresponding to coordinates [x, y, z]\r\n        - trans - array of number arrays describing the transform applied to the polygon. Each low level array contains four numbers of a transform row [qx, qy, qz, ax].\r\n        - zlow - lower bound on Z.\r\n        - zhigh - upper bound on Z.\r\n        - mask - `true` if this shape is a mask.\r\n        - invisible -`true` if this shape is invisible.\r\n    - planes - array of plane line clippings\r\n        - invisible - `true` if this union of plane clip intersections is invisible.\r\n        - clips - a union of plane clip set intersections\r\n            - normal - the plane's inward normal as a number array corresponding to coordinates [x, y ,z].\r\n            - dist - the plane's distance from the origin.\r\n            - invisible - `true` if this plane is invisible.\r\n            - interior - `true` if this plane is interior.\r\nperModelCategoryVisibility - array of objects containing perModelCategoryVisibility data\r\n    - modelId - id of model for which category override will apply.\r\n    - categoryId - id of category for which the override will apply.\r\n    - visible - boolean flag indicating if category is visible for the given model.\r\nviewMode - enumerator that specifies the transformation saved view mode. It can have two values: IncludeNewContent and FilterContent.\r\n    - IncludeNewContent includes all new content that was introduced into the iModel after the view was created.\r\n    - FilterContent filters out all new content that was introduced into the iModel after the view was created.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll ids must be well-formed valid hexadecimal ids conforming with [iTwin.js specification](https://www.itwinjs.org/learning/common/id64/?term=id64).\r\n\r\nPerModelCategoryVisibility override affects geometry on all subcategories belonging to the overridden category. That is, if the category is overridden to be visible, then geometry on all subcategories of the category will be visible, regardless of any subCategory overrides.\r\n\r\nIn addition to exported data, the transformer will also push some additional metadata. This metadata contains:\r\n1. `BisCore:RepositoryLink` and `BisCore:ExternalSource` elements that mark the source where the data was imported from.\r\n1. A \"Scope\" `BisCore:ExternalSourceAspect` that contains Synchronization changeset metadata that is needed by the transformation service to process any later changes correctly.\r\n1. Element provenance information (`BisCore:ExternalSourceAspects`) for elements that do not have federation guids.\r\n\r\n**Note**: Creating a configuration does not run the transformation.

Sending a post request will submit a background processing job that is able to report progress back to the same transformation instance that you can query by the transformation ID.\r\n\r\nFirst run of the transformation will process the whole source iModel and push data to the target iModel. \r\nOnly one transformation job can run on the same target iModel at the same time.\r\nConsecutively submitted jobs for the same configurationId will only process changes to the source iModel.\r\n\r\n### Transformation status\r\nTransformation `status` parameter provides information about the current status of a transformation. The status can have one of the following values:\r\n\r\n- `Created` - this status is assigned when the transformation is created, but background job has not started yet. Once the background job is started, initialization begins.\r\n\r\n- `Initializing` - a transformation in the `Initializing` status means that the background job has been started and is preparing to run the transformation. This process involves downloading all the necessary iModels and setting up other parameters as required by the transformation.\r\n\r\n- `Started` - when the transformation background job starts processing the iModel elements based on the transformation configuration, the status changes to `Started`. You can monitor the progress of the transformation during this stage by tracking the count of processed elements. This count allows you to estimate when the transformation might finish.\r\n\r\n- `Succeeded` - upon successful completion of the transformation, the status is set to `Succeeded`. This means all iModel elements have been processed as per the transformation configuration without any errors.\r\n\r\n- `Failed` - if an error occurs during the transformation process (while in the `Initializing` or `Started` statuses), the status changes to `Failed`. This indicates that the transformation has ended prematurely and would leave the target iModel in an invalid state if any intermediate changes were pushed. If the transformation is in an invalid state, it is necessary to use a new target iModel in order to proceed with further transformations.\r\n\r\n- `Aborted` - a transformation is labeled as `Aborted` when it is manually cancelled by the user. Note that a transformation cannot be cancelled if it has already finished (its status is either `Failed` or `Succeeded`).\r\n\r\n### Authentication\r\n\r\nRequires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `itwin-platform`.\r\n\r\nFor more documentation on authorization and how to get access token visit [OAUTH2 Authorization](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/authorization/) page.\r\n\r\n### Authorization\r\n\r\nYou must have `imodels_write` assigned at the target project level and `imodels_read` assigned at the source project level within related [configuration](/apis/transformations/operations/get-configuration/).

For more information about entities, see [Element Fundamentals](https://www.itwinjs.org/bis/guide/fundamentals/element-fundamentals/) and [Relationship Fundamentals](https://www.itwinjs.org/bis/guide/fundamentals/relationship-fundamentals/). If an iModel has more than 1000 entities, transformation will not succeed.

The target iModel must be a clone of the source iModel. You can clone the existing iModel using iModels API's endpoints:\r\n- [Create iModel](/apis/imodels-v2/operations/create-imodel/). \r\n- [Clone iModel](/apis/imodels-v2/operations/clone-imodel/). \r\n\r\nConsecutive CreateFork transformations may be used to pull changes from the main iModel into the fork iModel.\r\n\r\nTo synchronize changes in the \"reverse\" (fork -> main) direction see [MergeFork configuration](/apis/transformations/operations/mergefork/).\r\n\r\nIn addition to exported data, the transformer will also push some additional metadata. This metadata contains:\r\n1. `BisCore:RepositoryLink` and `BisCore:ExternalSource` elements that mark the source where the data was imported from.\r\n1. A \"Scope\" `BisCore:ExternalSourceAspect` that contains Synchronization changeset metadata that is needed by the transformation service to process any later changes correctly.\r\n1. Element provenance information (`BisCore:ExternalSourceAspects`) for elements that do not have federation guids.\r\n\r\n**Limitations**: Since an iModel can contain multiple forks there is a possibility that any given fork and the main iModel end up with conflicting schemas, e.g., the same ECProperty in one schema is of type \"number\" and in another schema it is of type \"string\". Schema conflicts are not handled by the transformations service and in these cases the transformation will fail.\r\n\r\n**Note**: Creating a configuration does not run the transformation.
