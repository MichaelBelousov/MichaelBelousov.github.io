On creation, webhook are inactive by default. To start receiving event, make a request to the [update webhook endpoint](/apis/webhooks-v2/operations/update-webhook/) with the `active` property set to `true`.\r\n\r\n#### Callback Url (Required)\r\n\r\nThe URL of the public endpoint all events will be sent to. `HTTPS` is required for this URL. This endpoint will receive requests containing events that have been triggered by different actions throughout the iTwin Platform. A POST request will be sent to this url when an event is triggered with event details in the body of the POST request.\r\n\r\n#### Scope (Required)\r\n\r\nThe `scope` property is required. Currently, there are two accepted value for `scope`: `Account`, `iTwin`.\r\n\r\nAll webhooks that are created with the `Account` scope are scoped to the account of the Service Application that created it. This means all events types the webhooks is subscribed to that happen inside that account will be sent to the webhook. Please be aware that Service Application's accounts are separate from the user's account that created the Service Application.\r\n\r\nIf the webhoook is created with the `iTwin` scope, then the property `scopeId` is required. `iTwin` scoped Webhooks will receive events for anything that is created directly inside of that `iTwin`.\r\n\r\n#### Secret (Optional)\r\n\r\nThe `secret` property is optional. If no secret is provided in the request a secret is generated and sent back in the response. If provided, the secret must be at least 32 characters.\r\n\r\nBefore forwarding an event to the client, the webhook secret is used together with the whole request body to generate a `HMAC-SHA256` signature which is included in the `Signature` request header. Before doing anything with the received event the callback endpoint should handle the authorization process by using its own webhook secret copy together with request body and generate another signature on their end to validate the event source. If both signatures are the same, the event should be accepted as authorized. If the signatures do not match the event should be ignored. An example of this workflow can be found in our [tutorial](/tutorials/create-and-react-to-events-using-webhooks-v2/#23-add-event-authorization) or in our [samples](/apis/webhooks-v2/samples/).\r\n\r\n#### Event Types (Required)\r\n\r\nA list of events the webhooks will be subscribed to. See the [Events](/apis/webhooks-v2/available-events) page for a detailed list of all available event types.\r\n\r\n#### Authentication\r\n\r\nWebhooks can only be created by a Service Application. This request requires an `Authorization` header with a valid Bearer token with the `webhooks:modify` scope. For more information on Service Applications and how to obtain an access token can be found [here](https://developer.bentley.com/tutorials/authorize-service/). A list of your Service Applications can be found [here](https://developer.bentley.com/my-apps).\r\n\r\n#### Authorization\r\n\r\nThe Service Application must have the `webhooks_maintainer` permission assigned at the iTwin level or be an Organization Administrator for the Organization that owns a given iTwin.\r\n\r\nAn Organization Administrator must have at least one of the following roles assigned in User Management: Account Administrator, Co-Administrator, or CONNECT Services Administrator.

In simple terms, webhooks (sometimes referred to as “HTTP callbacks”) are a way for apps to communicate with one another. Webhooks are an easy way to automate workflows inside of the iTwin Platform.\n\n## Webhook\n\nTo use webhooks you need to create a public endpoint in order to receive webhook events. You will need to provide this endpoint to the property `callbackUrl` when creating your webhook. This endpoint will receive requests containing events that have been triggered by different actions throughout the iTwin Platform. You can subscribe to events by passing a list of event types in the `eventTypes` property when creating your webhooks. A list of available event types can be found [here](/apis/webhooks-v2/#availableeventstypes). The `scope` property is required. Currently the only accepted value for `scope` is `Account`. An optional `secret` property can also be passed on creation. If no secret is passed one is generated and returned to you. The provided secret must be at least 32 characters. For more information on the `secret` property see [here](/apis/webhooks-v2/#webhooksecret). When webhooks are created they are deactive by default.\n\n### Authentication\n\nWebhooks can only be created by a Service Application. All requests require an `Authorization` header with a valid Bearer token with either the `webhooks:modify` or `webhooks:read` scope. The correct scope can be found in the documentation for the API request. For more information on Service Applications and how to obtain an access token can be found [here](/tutorials/authorize-service/). A list of your Service Applications can be found [here](/my-apps).\n\n### Available Events Types\n\nEvent type are structured : `api.action.version`.\n\nSee the [Events](/apis/webhooks-v2/events) page for a detailed list of available event types.\n\n### Event Payload Example\n\nThe following is an example of the payload for a `iTwins.iTwinCreated.v1` event. This event gets triggered when an iTwin is created. Event payloads will be the body of the POST request sent to the `callbackUrl` of the webhook. Each event type will have a different `content`, but the rest of the fields will always be included in the event payload. For more information on available events please refer to the [Events page](/api/webhooks-v2/events).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"content\": {\n    \"eventCreatedBy\": \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\",\n    \"iTwinAccountId\": \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\",\n    \"parentId\": \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\",\n    \"accountOwnerId\": \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\",\n    \"accountOwnerType\": \"User\",\n    \"iTwinClass\": \"Endeavor\",\n    \"iTwinSubClass\": \"Project\"\n  },\n  \"eventType\": \"iTwins.iTwinCreated.v1\",\n  \"iTwinId\": \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\",\n  \"enqueuedDateTime\": \"10/12/2023 6:25:39 PM\",\n  \"messageId\": \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\",\n  \"webhookId\": \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\"\n}\n```\n\n### Scope\n\nCurrently all webhooks that are created are scoped to the account of the Service Application that created it. This means all events types the webhooks is subscribed to that happen inside that account will be sent to the webhook. Please be aware that Service Application's accounts are separate from the user's account that created the Service Application.\n\n### Activation\n\nTo activate a new or existing webhook, make a request to the [Update webhook endpoint](/apis/webhooks-v2/operations/update-webhook/) with the `active` property set to `true`.\n\n## Event Delivery\n\nAn event is considered successfully delivered if the response from the provided `callbackUrl` is a 200 and has been received within the 5 seconds. The timeout of event delivery is 5 seconds. If the response is not a 200 or received past the 5 second timeout then the retry procedure is started or continued. Once the entire [retry procedure](/apis/webhooks-v2/#retryprocedure) completed and the event has still been failed to be delivered, the webhook is then deactivated. To reactive a webhook please see [here](/apis/webhooks-v2/#activation).\n\n### Timeout\n\nThe request to the provided `callbackUrl` has a timeout of 5 seconds. If a 200 response is not received in within the timeout window of 5 seconds the event delivery is considered as failed and the retry procedure is either started or continued.\n\n### Retry Procedure\n\nA failed event is retried a total of 12 times over the course of 3 days. If the event is still failing to be received successfully the webhook is then deactivated. To reactive a webhook please see [here](/apis/webhooks-v2/#activation).\n\n## Security\n\n### Webhook secret\n\nOn webhook creation, if no secret is provided in the request a secret is generated and sent back in the response. The provided secret must be at least 32 characters.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"webhook\": {\n    \"id\": \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\",\n    \"secret\": \"4eb25d308ef2a9722ffbd7a2b7e5026f9d1f2feaca5999611d4ef8692b1ad70d\",\n    \"callbackUrl\": \"https://some-callback.example.com\",\n    \"scope\": \"Account\",\n    \"scopeId\": \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000\",\n    \"active\": false,\n    \"eventTypes\": [\"iModels.iModelDeleted.v1\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBefore forwarding an event to client, webhook secret is used together with whole request body to generate `HMAC-SHA256` signature which is included in `Signature` request header. Before doing anything with the received event the callback endpoint should handle the authorization process by using its own webhook secret copy together with request body and generate another signature on their end to validate the event source. If both signatures are the same, event should be accepted as authorized one and ignored otherwise.\n","tutorialsMetadata":[{"title":"React to iModel events using Webhooks API","tile":{"name":"React to iModel events using Webhooks API","description":"This tutorial will teach you how to use Webhooks API to subscribe to iModel events and introduce basic event handling workflows.","href":"/tutorials/react-to-events-using-webhooks/","durationInMinutes":45,"relatedApiIds":["webhooks"]}},{"title":"React to events using Webhooks V2 API","tile":{"name":"React to events using Webhooks V2 API","description":"This tutorial will teach you how to use Webhooks API to subscribe to iModel events and introduce basic event handling workflows.","href":"/tutorials/react-to-events-using-webhooks-v2/","durationInMinutes":45,"relatedApiIds":["webhooks"]}}],"preloadedApis":[],"changelog":[],"preloadedSamples":[]},"__N_SSG":true}
