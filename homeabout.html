        <h3>Welcome (about me)</h3>

        <p>
        I'm a Computer Science and Engineering student at the University of Connecticut. I graduate in May 2019.
        This is my website, and for the most part my internet presence.
        </p>

        <p>
        I have several blog articles in the works, they're in the repository if you really want to see them, they simply
        aren't public because of their state and my indecisiveness when it comes to writing. I've also got to add a couple
        of features to the site, so pardon the construction. 
        </p>

        <p>
        I prefer my own private Gitlab and Gitolite managed source code to public Github, so I'll try to add links, descriptions,
        and mirrors for my own private projects where applicable in the future.
        </p>
