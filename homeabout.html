        <h3>Welcome (about me)</h3>

        <p>
        I'm a Computer Science and Engineering student at the University of Connecticut.
        This is my website, and hopefully my internet presence.
        </p>

        <p>
        Please note that this website is heavily under construction! 
        But the base seems to be all here so I've made it public. Hopefully
        I'll find time to write a little bit, and use more interesting CSS.
        </p>

        <p>
        Some software I have used on projects includes:
        </p>

            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Bash</li> 
            <li>Linux/GNU</li>

        <h3>State of this Site</h3>

        <p>
        This website has a lot more planned content, some of which was available but I do not feel
        was fleshed out enough and has since been hidden. Once I finish rewriting one particular article,
        I'll kickstart the blog, and I'll likely consolidate various other planned content areas into that.
