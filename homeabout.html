        <h3>Welcome (about me)</h3>

        <p>
        I'm a Computer Science and Engineering student at the University of Connecticut.
        This is my website, and hopefully my internet presence.
        </p>

        <p>
        Please note that this website is heavily under construction! 
        But the base seems to be all here so I've made it public. Hopefully
        I'll find time to write a little bit, and use more interesting CSS.
        </p>

        <p>
        Some software I am particularly fond of includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>C++</li> 
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>shell scripting</li> 
            <li>Linux/GNU</li> 
            <li>C</li> 
            <li>Vim</li>
            <li>Java</li> 
            <li>Scheme</li> 
            <li>JavaScript</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>State of this Site</h3>

        <p>
        This website has a lot more planned content, some of which was available but I do not feel
        was fleshed out enough and has since been hidden. Once I finish rewriting one particular article,
        I'll kickstart the blog, and I'll likely consolidate various other planned content areas into that.
