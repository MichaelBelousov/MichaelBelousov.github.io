        <h3>Welcome (about me)</h3>

        <p>
        I'm a Computer Science and Engineering graduate from the University of Connecticut. 
        This is my website, and for the most part my internet presence.
        </p>

        <p>
        I have several blog articles in the works, they're in the repository if you really want to
        see them, they simply aren't public because of their state and my indecisiveness when it
        comes to writing. Let me know if there's a feature I ought to add to the site.
        </p>

        <p>
        I'm in the process of moving some of my projects from private self-hosted gitlab
        to some open source GitHub projects. I'll try to highlight more projects in the future,
        check my blog.
        </p>
