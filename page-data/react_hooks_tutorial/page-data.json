Most of all you probably see something that isn't technically\nreal Javascript, JSX.\nThere's an open secret about modern web development. It's complicated. Really complicated.\nA-transpiles-to-B-transpiles-to-C-transpiles-to-Javascript complicated (more on the word\n<em>transpile</em> later. Maybe this isn't that\nsecret, but lots of web developers either ignore it or pretend it's easy after learning\n50 distinct technologies to make their website. This article will try to take the magic out,\nand hopefully show that there is a light at the  end of the tunnel.</p>\n<p>JSX is a very small one of those many technologies, a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows\nyou to declare HTML element trees in code instead of manually manufacturing them. Even\nmore specifically, JSX\nis really syntactic sugar used by the react ecosystem for constructing \"components\", a\nreusable chunk of HTML.\nTake for instance the following vanilla JavaScript script running in a simple webpage.\nIf you want to test it, you can run <code>python3 -m http.server</code> in a folder\ncontaining the two files, then you can see it at localhost:8000 in the browser.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">// index.js\nvar people = [{name: 'John', age: 25}, {name: 'Mike', age: 22}];\nvar root = document.getElementById('root');\nvar ul = document.createElement('ul');\nroot.appendChild(ul);\n\nfor (var i = 0; i &#x3C; people.length; i++) {\n  var li = document.createElement('li');\n  li.innerHTML = people[i].name + \" is \" + people[i].age + \" years old\";\n  ul.appendChild(li);\n}\n\n// If you've seen modern JavaScript, you'll notice there are\n// some no-nos above, there are better ways to do things now\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&#x3C;!DOCTYPE html>\n&#x3C;!-- index.html -->\n&#x3C;html>\n  &#x3C;body>\n    &#x3C;div id=\"root\">&#x3C;/div>\n  &#x3C;/body>\n  &#x3C;script src=\"/index.js\">&#x3C;/script>\n&#x3C;/html>\n</code></pre>\n<p>JSX gives us a much more declarative way to do this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">var people = [{name: 'John', age: 25}, {name: 'Mike', age: 22}];\n// once you know react, you'll know there's something else you need when generating\n// a dynamic list of children...\nReactDOM.render(\n  &#x3C;ul>\n    {people.map(person => &#x3C;li> {person.name} is {person.age} years old &#x3C;/li>)}\n  &#x3C;/ul>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>But there is one significant difference, JSX is only used in the react ecosystem,\nwhere DOM elements aren't actually built directly by consumers. That's why we need to tell React to run its own\nrender method given the JSX expression. JSX isn't equivalent to calling the DOM's element construction\nAPI/functions. Even though someone could write a JSX transpiler that did that, it's never seen\nwide adoption, probably due to the prevalence of React (You should probably look into\n<a href=\"https://svelte.dev/\">Svelte</a> if you're interested in something like that).\nIf we take what had above and see what the JSX transpiles to, we get the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">React.createElement('ui', null, \n  // the ... \"spread\" syntax used allows us to generate an arbitrary list of arguments.\n  // parameter #3 and beyond to the \"React.createElement\" function are the children of the element,\n  // and can be strings to be an html text node, or another complex element\n  ...people.map(p => React.createElement('li',  null, \n    `${p.name} is ${p.age} years old`\n  ))\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>React choosing to not use real elements allows it to have a light-weight representation of the DOM (this technique is called\nusing a <em>virtual DOM</em> or <em>VDOM</em>) that it can later efficiently update the real DOM to match. If you want\nto experiment with more JSX to regular JavaScript conversions, <a href=\"https://babeljs.io\">Babel</a>, the world's de facto JavaScript\ntranspiler has a <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/repl/#?browsers=defaults%2C%20not%20ie%2011%2C%20not%20ie_mob%2011&#x26;build=&#x26;builtIns=false&#x26;spec=false&#x26;loose=false&#x26;code_lz=GYVwdgxgLglg9mABACwKYBt1wBQEpEDeAUIogE6pQhlIA8AJjAG4B8AEhlogO5xnr0AhLQD0jVgG4iAXyJA&#x26;debug=false&#x26;forceAllTransforms=false&#x26;shippedProposals=false&#x26;circleciRepo=&#x26;evaluate=false&#x26;fileSize=false&#x26;timeTravel=false&#x26;sourceType=module&#x26;lineWrap=true&#x26;presets=react&#x26;prettier=false&#x26;targets=&#x26;version=7.9.6&#x26;externalPlugins=\">playground for JSX compilation</a>.</p>\n<p>For your reference, I'll leave here a terse demonstration of all JSX features and differences from HTML.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">//// dynamic children\nconst selfClosingTag = &#x3C;div />; // all tags can be self closing\nconst dynamicContent = &#x3C;span> {[selfClosingTag, selfClosingTag]} &#x3C;/span>; \nconst lists = &#x3C;span> {[selfClosingTag, selfClosingTag]} &#x3C;/span>; \nconst emptyContent = &#x3C;span> {} &#x3C;/span>; \nconst objects = &#x3C;span> {\"string object\"} {5} &#x3C;/span>; \n// this will throw an error, plain objects are not valid react elements\n//const emptyContent = &#x3C;span> {{}} {new Date()} &#x3C;/span>; \nconst emptyContent = &#x3C;span> {[&#x3C;a href=\"/link\"/>, 5, \"hello!\"]} &#x3C;/span>; \n\nconst optionalContent = &#x3C;span> {isLoading &#x26;&#x26; &#x3C;Loader/>} &#x3C;/span>;  // clever short-circuiting hacks\n// this will throw an error, lower case components CANNOT be user-defined, they're \"intrinsic components\", defined by HTML\n//const loader = &#x3C;myloader />; // won't compile!\nconst stringProp = &#x3C;MyLoader myCustomStringProp=\"string\" />; // prop is to attribute as component is to element in React\n// any object can be passed as a prop by using {} delimiters instead of quotes\nconst booleanProp = &#x3C;MyLoader myCustomStringProp />; //this is sugar for myCustomStringProp={true}\nconst numberProp = &#x3C;MyLoader myProp={5} />;\nconst anyObjectProp = &#x3C;MyLoader myProp={{an: \"object\"}} />; // prop is to attribute as component is to element in React\n// you can spread props\nconst examplePropObj = {prop1: \"value\", prop2: 3};\nconst spreadProps = &#x3C;MyLoader {...examplePropObj} {...{hello: \"world\"}} />; // just like spreading objects\n\n\n//// html differences\n// use \"className\" instead of \"class\"\n&#x3C;MyComponent className=\"my-css-class\" />\n// listeners on intrinsic elements take real callbacks and are camel-cased\n&#x3C;MyComponent onMouseEnter={mouseevent => console.log(mouseevent.target)} />\n// inline styles are camel-cased and objects instead of inline css\n&#x3C;MyComponent style={{\n  marginBottom: \"56px\",\n  marginTop: 0,\n}} />\n// A react \"fragment\" generates HTML without needing a parent tag, effectively\n// injecting the HTML chunk into the parent element, good for wrapping multiple conditional children\n&#x3C;div> {test &#x26;&#x26; &#x3C;>{\"hello!\"} {5}&#x3C;/>} &#x3C;/div> // if test is true, yields &#x3C;div>hello! 5&#x3C;/div>\n// You cannot use XML/HTML comments\n//&#x3C;> &#x3C;!-- not valid jsx --> &#x3C;/>\n// and you can't always use JS comments which sucks...\n// &#x3C;div>\n//   // this isn't valid JSX either\n// &#x3C;/div>\n// usually you can use this if you need a comment:\n&#x3C;div> {/* my valid comment */} &#x3C;/div>\n</code></pre>\n<p>The other main thing React allows, with JSX making it syntactically convenient, is user-defined\n\"components\", they look like normal HTML elements being used in JSX, but they have custom\nlogic in what attributes (<em>props</em> in React parlance) you can pass them, what\nHTML they generate with those attributes, and they can have their own internal state. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">function MyComponent(props) {\n  return props.person.age % 2 == 0 ? (\n    &#x3C;li> {props.person.name}'s age is divisible by &#x3C;strong>2&#x3C;/strong>! &#x3C;/li>\n  ) : (\n    &#x3C;li> {props.person.name} is {props.person.age} years old &#x3C;/li>\n  );\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  &#x3C;MyComponent person={{name: 'Mike', age: 30}} />,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>That example doesn't actually have state, just to note, but it does generate different\nHTML depending on what is passed to it.</p>\n<h2>Setting up JSX transpilation without magic</h2>\n<p>To <em>transpile</em> is like to compile, but instead of transforming a higher level source language into a lower level language,\nit is more indicative of transforming into a similar language. JSX to Javascript, is often called transpilation, probably\nbecause it's done often by Babel which is usually used for real transpilation of converting some JavaScript code into other\nJavaScript code using more well-supported features that most browsers will have implemented. As mentioned before, Babel\nis the world's most popular JavaScript transpiler. The most popular way to use React is with a tool called <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app\">create-react-app</a>.</p>\n<p>But CRA installs about 1500 packages as of today, and uses a <em>bundler</em>, webpack, that manages a transpiler toolchain and hides\nthe nitty-gritty real stuff from you. You should work without webpack at least once, but I do recommend using webpack for heavy\nproducts and definitely anything in production, so you can get optimization and hot-reloading during development.</p>\n<p>Another tool that is thankfully less magical and we will make use of here, is TypeScript. We won't focus on TypeScript much itself, but it will\nlet us look at the nitty gritty while still developing React comfortably. If you haven't already, now is the time to install <a href=\"https://nodejs.org\">Node.js</a>,\nI recommending using a Node installation management program like <a href=\"https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm\">nvm</a>, or if you're on windows,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows\">nvm-windows</a>, to install it. Use it to install a capable version of Node like the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">nvm install 12.16.3\nnvm use 12.16.3\n</code></pre>\n<p>With node installed, comes its package manager, <code>npm</code>. We could already install <code>create-react-app</code> here, but we're just going to\nonly install typescript, which will give us the typescript compiler program, <code>tsc</code>. Install it globally (as opposed to the current\ndirectory/project) using <code>npm</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">npm install --global typescript\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now you should be able to run <code>tsc -h</code>, to see some of the options. TypeScript's job for us is not just to compile typescript to JavaScript, but more importantly to\ntranspile our JSX to React, since it supports JSX in <code>.tsx</code> files. For this article, our goal will be to create a point-buy system\nfor an RPG character UI. We'll use React with and without hooks, see the difference, and employ some basic css to make it stylish.</p>\n<h2>modules</h2>\n<p>We will make our React and ReactDOM libraries globals variables in the browser by linking them in the HTML. We will use the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/umdjs/umd\">UMD</a> packaged version of React, hosted by\nsome friendly denizens of the internet <a href=\"https://www.jsdelivr.com/\">jsdelivr</a> which are a Content Delivery Network or CDN, so they host common\nfiles like packaged React builds for us. There are a lot of module formats for JS, but UMD uses a global variable in the browser which makes it\nthe easiest for us to consume without a bundler like webpack to process it for us.\nYou can use jsdelivr's search bar to find React, but here's <a href=\"https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/react?path=umd\">a link</a>\ndirectly to their page on provided UMD packages of React. Go ahead and hit the copy clipboard icon and\ncopy the HTML vesion and load that script in out HTML. It will already be set to the latest stable\nversion which should be fine. You also need the latest version of <code>react-dom</code> which you can find\nusing the jsDelivr search bar or <a href=\"https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/react-dom?path=umd\">here</a>.\nYour script should look like this, note that both react dependencies are loaded before our site's\nown script.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&#x3C;!DOCTYPE html>\n&#x3C;!-- index.html -->\n&#x3C;html>\n  &#x3C;head>\n  &#x3C;/head>\n  &#x3C;body>\n    &#x3C;div id=\"root\">&#x3C;/div>\n  &#x3C;/body>\n  &#x3C;script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/react@16.13.1/umd/react.development.js\">&#x3C;/script>\n  &#x3C;script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/react-dom@16.13.1/umd/react-dom.development.js\">&#x3C;/script>\n  &#x3C;script src=\"/index.js\">&#x3C;/script>\n&#x3C;/html>\n</code></pre>\n<p>TypeScript is only designed to really work with packages, so it won't understand yet that we're\nexpecting React to already exist in global scope. This makes sense, since TypeScript wants to know\nthe type of everything that is being used, including imported functions. Normally, we'd install the React\npackage and import it in typescript as such:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-tsx\">import React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\n</code></pre>\n<p>Instead, we will simply tell typescript using the <em>declare</em> keyword, that something exists that\nit can't tell by itself. We won't go any further into typescript, this will shut up the compiler.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-tsx\">declare var React: any;\ndeclare var ReactDOM: any;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This tells typescript that it should expect the names React and ReactDOM were declared using the \"var\"\nkeyword somewhere before the code the compiler is processing, and it tells the compiler to not care\nabout their type by giving them the type, <code>any</code>. We lose valuable typechecking, but it makes\nthings less complicated to start; we'll still get valuable type checking for our own stuff, but\nnot when we use the React and ReactDOM names.</p>\n<p>Let's get our new <code>index.tsx</code> file off the ground:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-tsx\">declare var React: any;\ndeclare var ReactDOM: any;\n\nclass AttributeCounter extends React.Component {\n  constructor() {\n    this.state = { value: 10 };\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &#x3C;span>\n        {this.props.name}: {this.state.value}\n        &#x3C;button>+&#x3C;/button>\n        &#x3C;button>-&#x3C;/button> \n      &#x3C;/span>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nfunction PointBuy(props) {\n  return (\n    &#x3C;AttributeCounter name={\"Strength\"} />\n    &#x3C;AttributeCounter name={\"Charisma\"} />\n    &#x3C;AttributeCounter name={\"Wisdom\"} />\n  );\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  &#x3C;PointBuy/>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now run <code>tsc</code> with the <code>--jsx</code> setting set to \"react\" (it can also not transpile it or target react for iOS). Run it:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">tsc --jsx react  index.tsx\n</code></pre>\n<p>Typescript will create the index.js file for you or yell at you if you made a mistake. You can open it and see some neat tricks, including the converted JSX,\nas well as transpilation of other not-well supported javascript features like the class is compiled to a function with a \"prototype\" property attached to it.\nYou can read up on prototype based inheritance and JavaScript's object/class model\n<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain\">elsewhere</a>,\nsince that's not in scope here. Either way, you should now\nbe able to run a server, like the Python simple http server mentioned earlier, navigate to <code>index.html</code> and see React render out 3 values and 3 \"+\" buttons, and 3 \"-\" buttons.\nWith React working, we can talk about state, and what that \"useState\" function does, and how we're going to use state differently in that class component.</p>\n<h2>hooks, class components, and state</h2>\n<p>React 16.8 introduced the concept of <em>hooks</em>. React already had what they call <em>functional components</em>, which is where a function takes an object of props as an argument,\nand returns a JSX fragment. Hooks allow you to \"hook\" into React's render logic specific to the currently rendering component. This can be used to identify each component\nin the rendered component tree, which means functional components which normally only have access to props can now store their own state in a way unique to the component instance.\nWith that, you can ditch the use of classes entirely, but we'll come back to this after we learn how to use state the old way in React anyway.</p>\n<p>You'll notice we used a class in our <code>index.tsx</code> already. This is the old way of creating stateful components that can rerender themselves. You simply inherit (extend)\nthe official React.Component class, and override its lifecycle methods, in this case just the \"render\" method. In these objects, state is an object property of a component instance,\nbut you can't set it the same way as you normally do in JavaScript. To set state, you need to do it in a way that React knows, so you use the inherited method, <code>setState</code>,\nwhich takes an object containing all of the changed state values. Let's make that \"+\" button increment the <code>value</code> property of the state.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-tsx\">class AttributeCounter extends React.Component {\n  constructor() {\n    this.state = { value: 10 };\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &#x3C;span>\n        {this.props.name}: {this.state.value}\n        &#x3C;button onClick={() => {\n          this.setState({value: this.state.value+1});\n        }}>+&#x3C;/button>\n        &#x3C;button>-&#x3C;/button> \n      &#x3C;/span>\n    );\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>To do so, we use React's built-in support for setting a listener similiarly to how we would on the DOM, but directly on the component and taking an actual function reference.\nOn the DOM you'd have to pass a name to a function in scope to the \"onclick\" attribute, or manually find the element, probably by setting some id attribute, and use the DOM\nelement API to attach and possibly remove the listener. But here we can just use an arrow function inline to run our component instance's <code>setState</code> method to increment the value.\nNext we decrement for the \"-\" button:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-tsx\">class AttributeCounter extends React.Component {\n  constructor() {\n    this.state = { value: 10 };\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &#x3C;span>\n        {this.props.name}: {this.state.value}\n        &#x3C;button onClick={() => this.setState({value: this.state.value+1})}>+&#x3C;/button>\n        &#x3C;button onClick={() => this.setState({value: this.state.value-1})}>-&#x3C;/button>\n      &#x3C;/span>\n    );\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In original React, this was the only way to use state in a way that would cause components to rerender.\nThe point of React, is that components only rerender when their state changes. This old way isn't bad,\nbut it's\na lot of boiler plate, and we aren't using any of the life cycle methods at all yet. This works because our component class gives us\na new instance of the component each time React needs one, and we store the state on that component until the component is unmounted by\nReact and its instance and state variables can be garbage collected.\nWhen we call <code>ReactDOM.render</code>, we give it our React element to render, created by the implicit React.createElement which we're using JSX\nto hide. When the react element to be rendered is a class, an instance is initialized, rendered,\nand mounted (<em>mounted</em> is React jargon for its resulting render HTML is added to the DOM and\nReact is keeping track of it).</p>\n<p>If you pass a function to <code>React.createElement</code>, React can't create an instance, so it just runs the function with the props object as an argument\nfrom the parent. So two different instances of a functional component use the same function, and have\nno state. A functional component used like <code>&#x3C;MyFunction a={5} b={\"hello\"} c /></code> would be interpreted by React as <code>MyFunction({a: 5, b:\"hello\", c: true})'</code>. Then\nwhatever JSX-fragment/React-element that functional component returns is rendered with its components in turn, and any intrinsic elements or strings marked as literal return.\nThe point is, there is no state this way, just the props passed by the parent.</p>\n<p>But we can have state in functional components, when React pays attention to the render order in the tree. Before we start using state in\nour functional component using hooks, lets look at where that state is stored, so we can better understand some of the restrictions hooks will\nimpose.</p>\n<p>Suppose we have the following React app:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\n\nfunction C() { return \"hello\"; }\n\nfunction B(props) {\n  return (\n    &#x3C;div> &#x3C;C/> {props.b &#x26;&#x26; &#x3C;C/>} &#x3C;/div>\n  );\n}\n\nclass A() {\n  constructor() {\n    this.state = { a: true };\n    setTimeout(() => this.setState({a: false}), 5000); // in 5 seconds make false\n  }\n  render() {\n    return &#x3C;B b={this.state.a}/>;\n  }\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(&#x3C;A/>, root);\n</code></pre>\n<p>So the App is an <code>A</code> component, when A is rendered, it tells React to render one child <code>B</code> with a prop of <code>b</code> as <code>true</code> which is\nderived from its state of <code>a</code>. <code>B</code> renders two <code>C</code> components, because its <code>b</code> component as passed to it was true, and the <code>&#x26;&#x26;</code> expression evaluated\nvia short-circuiting to a <code>B</code> element.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n  <img style=\"width:600px\" alt=\"YOU CAN'T SEE THIS IMAGE\" src=\"/images/component-tree.svg\" />\n</div>\n<p>You can see that the <code>C</code> function component was called twice, each time for a unique child of <code>B</code>.\nWhen React traverse the render tree, after the state update, and sees that the second <code>C</code> is gone, it\nwill unmount it, which means React no longer listens for updates to that component's props or state.\nNow let's create the same thing using hooks for state.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\n\nconst C = () => &#x3C;>\"hello\"&#x3C;/>;\n\nconst B = props => &#x3C;div> &#x3C;C/> {props.b &#x26;&#x26; &#x3C;C/> &#x3C;/div>;\n\nconst A = () => {\n  const [a, setA] = React.useState(true);\n  useEffect(() => {\n    setTimeout(() => setA(false), 5000);\n  }, []);\n  return &#x3C;B b={a} />;\n};\n\nReactDOM.render(&#x3C;A/>, root);\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this iteration I opted to switch to using arrow functions which are often much nicer (once\nyou're used to them), and have other benefits compared to old-school function literals. Regardless,\nyou can see a lot of new stuff going on already to do the same thing. Since function components\nare always the render function, there is no \"constructor\" or other life cycle method which we\ncan use to set our timeout in. Instead, we have to learn about the concept of <em>effects</em>.</p>\n<p>An effect, is a function that React will run after each render, possibly with a list of\n<em>dependencies</em>, states that if changed trigger the effect. Probably my favorite thing about\nhooks, is how they can truly turn components into finite state machines with effects.\nYou have multiple state properties, and multiple effects that run at each state change, and can\nlisten to only when a particular state changes.</p>\n<p>In <code>A</code> above, our effect says \"after each render, if any of the states in this list, <code>[]</code>, changed,\nset a timeout that sets the state <code>a</code> to <code>false</code> in 5000 milliseconds\". When you consider that\n<code>[]</code> has no states in it and realize it will never change and therefore only happens after the first\nrender, you have one of the first React hooks idioms, which I'll call <code>useDoAfterMount</code>. Together, it's,\n\"after mount, set a timeout to change the state of <code>a</code> to <code>false</code> in 5000 milliseconds\".</p>\n<p>As for the <code>useState</code> hook, it allows you to allocate one cell of state for the currently rendering\ncomponent in the component tree, with an initial value. This initial value is ignored in future renders.\nWe will return to that, but for now, suppose we added some hook state to our <code>C</code> components:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">import {useState} from \"react\";\n\nconst C = () => {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(5);\n  useEffect(() => { setInterval(() => setCount(prev=>prev+1), 1000); }, []);\n  return &#x3C;>{count}&#x3C;/>;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is a more advanced usage of a react state dispatcher (the <code>setCount</code> function returned by\n<code>useState</code>). Instead of a new value, you can pass a function that gets the current value and\ncreates a new one from it, like how above we increment from the current value which I nickname\nprev (since it's about to become the previous value). Because <code>setInterval</code> runs the function\nevery second, it will keep going up. If we didn't use a function for the dispatcher call, we\nwould do the following, which has a bug:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const C = () => {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(5);\n  useEffect(() => { setInterval(() => setCount(count+1), 1000); }, []);\n  return &#x3C;>{count}&#x3C;/>;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is probably one of the hardest challenges of starting hooks. What's wrong with this code?\nThe issue is, when the first render is ran, and the useEffect's function is parsed, the value of\ncount is <code>5</code>. Since the dependencies never change (the dependency list is empty still), the hook\nisn't re ran. That same function of <code>setCount(5+1)</code> is ran every second, effectively not changing\nanything. Alright then, how about then we use that fancy dependency list then?</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const C = () => {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(5);\n  useEffect(() => { setInterval(() => setCount(count+1), 1000); }, [count]);\n  return &#x3C;>{count}&#x3C;/>;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Alright, so now this... probably won't work. Think about it. On the first render, the function is called,\nand the effect is ran, adding code of <code>setCount(5+1)</code> to be called every second. One second passed, the\nstate changes (<code>count</code> is now 6), and react rerenders, rerunning the function but this time useState\nreturns 6 instead of the initial state which it ignores, 5. <code>count</code> has now changed, so the effect runs\nagain, adding <em>another</em> code body to set state this time to <code>setCount(6+1)</code> every second. One more\nsecond passes, and now <em>both</em> functions execute in an unpredictable order. Which will occur first and\nwhich last? Will your the state of <code>count</code> be <code>7</code> or <code>6</code>? It gets worse, because this balloons up and\na minute later you now have 60 functions running per second, all setting the state to different things.\nAvoiding dependencies on state when you can just transform the current state in the dispatcher's\nargument is key to avoiding asynchronous programming headaches, so use it whenever possible.</p>\n<p>With that out of the way, we can take the brief descriptions and formalize what the <code>useState</code> hook\ndoes, and why React actually has something called the <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html\">rules of hooks</a>.\n<code>useState</code> allocates a singular state reference for the currently rendering component when the\ncomponent is first rendered. On all renders, it then returns the current state. Notice, that the\n<code>useState</code> parameters don't include any identifier for identifying which state you want, you don't\nask for <code>useState('count', 5)</code>. This is because React uses the ordered nature of javascript to\nfigure out which state you're asking for. Because of using this order, you <em>cannot use hooks in\nconditional code</em>. You have to extract it from the conditional code, or strange thing could happen.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">const C = props => {\n  const [a, setA] = useState(true);\n  let b, setB, c, setC;\n  if (props.blah) {\n    [b, setB] = useState([]);\n  } else if {\n    [c, setC] = useState({});\n  }\n  return null; // same as empty jsx\n};\n\nconst B = props => {\n  return &#x3C;> &#x3C;C/> &#x3C;C/> &#x3C;>\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>When <code>C</code> renders, React allocates two state cells, but if <code>props.blah</code> flips its truth value,\nthen <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> will flip which state they get from React. For these reasons, people usually use\nlinters to detect and warn them about using hooks in ways that can cause this strange behavior.\nFor the same reasons, you cannot run hooks in loops or other dynamic ways, they need to be run\nat function scope.</p>\n<!-- transition? -->\n<p>Now, let's have a final note on the alternative to class instances, and then we can really get to work.\nWhen <code>B</code> renders, how does React know which <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> state references to give to it?\nUnlike the class components where React keeps and maintains an instance, React needs to think a bit\nharder. React remembers the <em>path</em> it took to render this component. If we were to run\n<code>ReactDOM.render(&#x3C;B/>, root)</code>, React sees three component instances. It sees something like:</p>\n<pre><code>1: \n  path: /B\n  renderer: B\n2: \n  path: /B/C:1\n  renderer: C\n\n3: \n  path: /B/C:2\n  renderer: C\n</code></pre>\n<p>But if you look at our first example of JSX, how can it tell where components are in the render\nfunction if they are generated dynamically like so?</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">var people = [{name: 'John', age: 25}, {name: 'Mike', age: 22}];\nReactDOM.render(\n  &#x3C;ul>\n    {people.map(person => &#x3C;li> {person.name} is {person.age} years old &#x3C;/li>)}\n  &#x3C;/ul>,\n  root\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>You could associate state by the order they come in, but react does one better and requires you to\npass a special key prop in all list-generated children to tell react which is which, allowing\nyour list to be in any order and change in any way. If a component shows up with a different key,\nit will be newly mounted with fresh state, if a component's props change but it has the same key,\nit is identified as the owner of that state and rerenders. It is important that your keys are\nunique, or React will only render one of them.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">ReactDOM.render(\n  &#x3C;ul>\n    {people.map(p => &#x3C;li key={p.name}> {p.name} is {p.age} years old &#x3C;/li>)}\n  &#x3C;/ul>,\n  root\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>And with that in-depth explanation of most of reacts internals, we should be set to build our\nRPG point buy system for real, let's return to our original concept with some tweaks:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-tsx\">declare var React: any;\ndeclare var ReactDOM: any;\n\nclass AttributeCounter extends React.Component {\n  constructor() {\n    this.state = { value: 10 };\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &#x3C;span>\n        {this.props.name}: {this.state.value}\n        &#x3C;button>+&#x3C;/button>\n        &#x3C;button>-&#x3C;/button> \n      &#x3C;/span>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nfunction PointBuy(props) {\n  return (\n    &#x3C;AttributeCounter name={\"Strength\"} />\n    &#x3C;AttributeCounter name={\"Charisma\"} />\n    &#x3C;AttributeCounter name={\"Wisdom\"} />\n  );\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  &#x3C;PointBuy/>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's start by <em>lifting</em> the state out of the children into the parent, so that the parent\ncan impose concurrent constraints.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-tsx\">declare var React: any;\ndeclare var ReactDOM: any;\n// extrace useState function from react\nconst { useState } = React;\n\nclass AttributeCounter extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      &#x3C;span>\n        {this.props.name}: {this.props.value}\n        &#x3C;button onClick={this.props.onInc>+&#x3C;/button>\n        &#x3C;button onClick={this.props.onDec>-&#x3C;/button>\n        &#x3C;button>-&#x3C;/button> \n      &#x3C;/span>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nfunction PointBuy(props) {\n  const [str, setStr] = useState(10);\n  const [cha, setCha] = useState(10);\n  const [wis, setWis] = useState(10);\n  return (\n    &#x3C;AttributeCounter name={\"Strength\"} value={str}\n      onInc={()=>setStr(p=>p+1)} onDec={()=>setStr(p=>p-1)}\n    />\n    &#x3C;AttributeCounter name={\"Charisma\"} value={cha}\n      onInc={()=>setCha(p=>p+1)} onDec={()=>setCha(p=>p-1)}\n    />\n    &#x3C;AttributeCounter name={\"Wisdom\"} value={wis}\n      onInc={()=>setWis(p=>p+1)} onDec={()=>setWis(p=>p-1)}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  &#x3C;PointBuy/>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>And if you get this far... well you're going to have to do the rest now!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"React and its hooks without Create React App","path":"/blog/react-hooks-tutorial","date":"May 06, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/react_hooks_tutorial/"}}}
