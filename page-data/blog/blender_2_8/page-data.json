I bumped the resolution to\n5000x5000 pixels, and had to think deeply about it.</p>\n<p>The lack of dynamic resolution in such raster based image manipulation programs is saddening. Especially\nin my drafting process. It's inconvenient to have to worry about blurry details when zooming in too far, or slow stroke\nrendering/committing when zooming out too much. So, since I already use Blender for practically everything else and\nwas enjoying the quality of life improvements in Blender 2.8 recently, I decided to check out its new 2D (Grease Pencil) tools for kicks.\nLo and behold, the lagless, vector-based, infinite resolution, hassle-free zoom, layered, materialed, simple, beautiful 2D workspace of my\ndreams was before me. Gone are the drafting days of drawing arrows to various scene elements to elaborate on them.\nJust zoom into them! You can just zoom infinitely and write inside them. The brushes are clean, and\ncustomizable. Erasing is instant (use point-erase), and rendering is lagless. And since you're not\ndealing with raster, there are <em>no</em> complex selections to perform. You can select strokes independently,\nselect their points, move things, scale things, and it takes no time at all. You can <em>sculpt</em> your points,\nadding or reducing thickness of lines, moving them, adding some fuzziness, simplifying them, and more. It's not\njust good for drafting, but all drawing comes naturally to it. And you can even extend it to 3D! Draw in 3D,\nstart modeling in 3D. Draw on your 3D models to concept some greebling if your artstyle demands it!\nIt has never felt so easy to me. Blender has always been good at what it does,\nbut it has never felt so exceptionally designed until now. Whether you're designing interfaces or levels, doing\n3D graphics work, doing 2D work, or any animation, definitely get into Blender 2.8 and start a new 2D drawing\nproject. It just works!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Blender 2.8 Grease Pencil Is Awesome","path":"/blog/blender-2.8-grease-pencil-is-awesome","date":"July 13, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/blender_2_8/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
