As sprawling, seemingly\nomnipotent, tech companies take on the mantle of our keepers, consumer technology\nbecomes only a window to services running in the cloud. The cloud is becoming\nprevalent, an industry mainstay and perhaps soon structural monopoly.\nSo prevalent in fact, that the entire tech industry is moving towards the\nmobile-first (or desktop-never) paradigm. the technological limits of the \nclient are hardly a concern when the technology isn&#39;t in the client. For years,\nthe industry struggled with barely-equipped clients outdated hardware,\nand recalcitrant hardware. And now, finally, we are able to decouple the\nserver from client, implementation from interface, to the purest degree.\nSoon, supercomputers tied to our desire will be a tap away and we consumers\nwon&#39;t need to think, so much as worry, about storage, memory, performance, \nmaintenance, reliability, etc, etc, or any of the other problems that come \nwith realtime systems. Instead it will all be done for us, a silicon pampering.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\nYou should be worried.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\nI have maybe 4 opening paragraphs written for this post, I promise to finish it\nlater. I have more thoughts on the subject now, and I think it&#39;s more delicate \nand needs to be more thoroughly\ndissected. I&#39;ll get it done eventually, but for now, understand please that\nI don&#39;t shun cloud computing, in fact I think it&#39;s a highly valuable tool including\nat the consumer level. But I\nwant the reader to bear in mind that we&#39;re giving away all of our power here,\nedging on subservience. Even now, as companies are being blamed for users they\ncannot help, and then controlling content that an open medium would [should] have\nno control over, we can see the manifestation of the bloat that started years ago.\nThis article will hopefully tackle the Facebook/Cambridge-Analytica incident and\nwhy it shouldn&#39;t be a surprise to the cognizant internet user, and what the\nrealization should reveal to those who were previously unaware. Or at least my \npersonal thoughts on the subject.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;!--\n&lt;p&gt;\nThere&#39;s no such thing as a free lunch. And Facebook,\nGoogle, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple (more on this later), \nhave been serving us a decent cafeteria lunch for over a decade. The issue is,\ncloud computing is convenient. And it makes sense. For lots of things,\nbut not for everything. In fact, it&#39;s downright dangerous, as we are about to\nembark on entrusting all of our computing and information to the great\ntech conglomerates. The problem lies not in technology, and not in politics, \nbut in principle.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\nWe&#39;ll come back to that. But first, we must answer the question of what the \ninternet even &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;.\nWell, the internet is a &lt;i&gt;medium&lt;/i&gt;. Like water or air, perhaps more specifically\na mall, spefically the space in the mall, or even a town with stores and roads. \nIt&#39;s a mechanism through which we can move, communicate,\nshare, exchange, own, etc. Once this becomes clear, a number of ramifications are\nmade apparent. \n...\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\nAs technology becomes a founding pillar of modern society, we are, astonishingly,\nhanding the keys to the reigning lords. The worst thing we can do in this\nreality complicated by politics, unbridled certainty, and agendas, is give away\nour freedom out of mere convenience. \n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\nA new technological pandemic has been silently surfacing for the last\ntwo decades. Its effect has been subtle, but it&#39;s consequences were immediate \nsince, yet only now are they beginning to leak into conspicuity.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\nWith the great Cambridge Analytica media belly-flop, the American nation\nsaw, and misinterpretted its first glimpse of the tumor that has manifested.\nThe reception was not unexpected, in fact it is rather lamentably precedented.\nFacebook, and chiefly the mediocre Mark Zuckerberg are to blame\nfor the escape of millions of web citizens&#39; &lt;i&gt;information&lt;/i&gt;, an oblivious\nmisnomer. \n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\nGoogle, another principal player in what inevitably boils down to the data\ngame, has been a tad smarter with their grasp. And still, Google &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;\nYouTube, one of the most influential media networks in modern history.\nIn Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, etc, lie some of the greatest\nraw power in History, and we, the people, have been giving it to them gladly\nfor the last twenty years. All of a sudden, they are imposing rules, a \nprivilege they rightfully own, on what many perceived as free interchange.\nBut it isn&#39;t free, it shouldn&#39;t be, and it doesn&#39;t need to be. Because\nsomething more important is free.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\nFacebook having given away our information is not baffling whatsoever. It is\nnearly an implication of the system of which we have been happily conforming\nto neatly.  What is, and should be dumbfounding is that we have allowed\nthe utter dominance of centralization at all.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\nTo ascribe the responsiblity of the Cambridge Analytica scandal to Facebook is\nnot an error per se, as a misplacement of thought. The error lies in us giving\nour information freely to a glorified advertisement firm. Skepticism is key to \noptimism, but now our society is now accelerating towards technological subservience.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\nThe reason the public has trodden the path of centralization is purely availability,\nwhich is itself rooted in the simplicity of centralization in the software industry.\nThe issue, however, is that centralization is an &lt;i&gt;intra-net&lt;/i&gt; principle.\nDeeply nested within the internet itself, is the reality that our digital world is\nan &lt;i&gt;inter-net&lt;/i&gt;, and the only thing that could possibly change that would\nbe the complete monopolization and the simple autocratization of the internet.\nI hope we can agree that is an unfavorable end.\nAs the natural state of the system is between (inter) users, and not amongst (intra)\nusers, the only stable solution is that each user should be capable of\nyielding their own services. When Google yields them for us, we waive our right\nto the internet.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\nHumans have a deep need, a primordial predisposition, to shape the bizarre tumult before\nus into a neat stream. That is doubtlessly a correct, and even accurate response, \nbut care must be taken to note the instances of pure chaos. This preposensity has\nled us to assign blame across the internet to the deliverers.\nUnrealistic expectations for simple algorithms. And we keep shooting the messengers.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\nNow, as the sickness is making its rounds, we need to bring availability to the\npeer-to-peer service model. We need to build a content-serving network\nto rival YouTube and Facebook. An application and system that is consumer-friendly,\nand consumer-hosted. Redundant, distributed, flexible, and free of the middle man. \nA true anarchy that should satisfy the libertarian mind. A pure framework, where\nresponsiblity can&#39;t be directly assigned to any third-party, where the consumer\nis alone, but the consumers are united, and even if the implementers regretted\nthemselves (I have a feeling they wouldn&#39;t), it would be figuratively in perpetual\nmotion, an unstoppable force. \n&lt;/p&gt;\n--&gt;</code></pre></div>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"","path":null,"date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/phones_suck/"}}}
