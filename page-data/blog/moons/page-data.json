His eyes turned up at the incipient storm shadowing the span of blue. One could still\nmake out the three earthly satellites:<!-- moons? --> Uvon, Craete and Borud, which were nearing each other in their\ndisparate orbits, but the heavy weather would soon disguise that.</p>\n<!-- \nsomething about tides or weather\nperhaps a naval battle.\n\nmaybe replace \"Kittings\" with engineer?\n-->\n<p>Kittings meandered one leg over the railing, and checked the cable pulley on the gut of his suit before letting\nhis other leg slump over, he dropped the few inches of slack. He unspooled along the dripping grey hull, which\nrocked in a deep rhythm. He finished his descent just at a glass bubble that receded into the shining plated hull.</p>\n<p>Quickly, he got to work, opening the front pouch of his suit, and undoing the screws that held the glass over the\ndevice. With his gloves, he gently rotated and pulled out the protective glass and clipped it onto a loose hook\nhanging from his suit, behind it was a cascade of black geometry, overlapping ceramic shapes made up an intricate sensor\nthat informed many of the ship's impressive subsystems. Kittings took another tool out from his pouch and against\nthe ship's rhthym, he tried several times to reach a miniscule compartment. Upon success, a small cover popped open\nunveiling a control panel with a blinking yellow light. Kittings poked a tiny button promptly, and waited for\nthe sensor to reboot. The crashes beneath reached his feet briefly and he looked down again, noting the soft red\nreflection of Borud in the murky depths. The sensor beeped instructively, and he expectantly noted the continued\nyellow indicator. He pried at another latch by the control panel, until he opened the signal wiring cabinet, revealing a\nfrayed wire amongst the line of black cables, and a charred insect. Kittings grabbed the affected line with his\ncoated tongs and yanked it, then tapped the rigid corpse banishing it into the ocean. Finally, he pulled a replacement\nfrom his kit and shoved it into the previous line's slot until it connected.</p>\n<!-- maybe add a sense of temporal urgency? -->\n<p>Kittings clasped the two panels shut and returned the glass, screwing it back in. As he pushed the drill into the last\nscrew, the thud of a wave against the ship shifted his wrist, the drills force on the screw buckled and it fell spinning\nbeneath, almost immediately lost from his sight. It didn't matter, he pulled another one from his pouch and replaced it.\nFinished, he clicked a button on the cable carrying him and it pulled, letting him walk briskly up the hull, where he\nunzipped the suit, attached it to the pouch he got it from and clicked the seal button. He watched the vacuum drag the suit\ninto the small box quickly, and put it back urgently, then jogged to the door, held open by Lieutenant Bander.</p>\n<!-- need more magical realism so the ethereal being at the end isn't offputting/forced -->\n<p>Once Kittings was inside the soft red glowing corridors of the vessel, Bander shut the door and initiated the seal routine.\nIn the bridge, the admiral and various seated officers waited in silence as the vessel descended.</p>\n<!-- is there a word for spelunking style lowering by cable?
