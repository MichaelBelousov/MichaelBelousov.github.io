    Some good reads include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Charles Petzold's 
            <i>The Annotated Turing</i></li>
        <li> Douglas Hofstadter's 
            <i>Godel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid </i> 
            (that one is too obvious)</li>
        <li> Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels</li>
        <li> Scott Meyer's 
            <i>[Modern] Effective C++</i></li>
        <li>
            <i>The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i></li>
        <li> Orson Scott Card's Ender series </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    I must also say, however, that I wish I read more, 
    that list should be much much longer.
